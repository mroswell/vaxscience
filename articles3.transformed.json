      "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented setback for global economy and health. Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions to substantially reduce severe disease and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination programmes are being rolled out globally, but most of these vaccines have been approved without extensive studies on their side-effects and efficacy. Recently, new-onset autoimmune phenomena after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported increasingly (e.g. immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, autoimmune liver diseases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, IgA nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus). Molecular mimicry, the production of particular autoantibodies and the role of certain vaccine adjuvants seem to be substantial contributors to autoimmune phenomena. However, whether the association between",

      "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 and adverse reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations show a tropism for neuronal structures and tissues. This narrative review was conducted to collect and discuss published data about neurological side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in order to discover type, frequency, treatment, and outcome of these side effects. The most frequent neurological side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are headache, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), venous sinus thrombosis (VST), and transverse myelitis. Other neurological side effects occur in a much lower frequency. Neurological side effects occur with any of the approved vaccines but VST particularly occurs after vaccination with vector-based vaccines. Treatment of these side effects is not at variance from similar conditions due to other causes. The worst outcome of these side effects is associated with VST, why it should not be missed and treated appropriately in due time. In conclusion, safety concerns against SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are backed by an increasing number of studies reporting neurological side effects. The most frequent of them are headache, GBS, VST, and transverse myelitis. Healthcare professionals, particularly neurologists involved in the management of patients having undergone",

      "Abstract": "The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global effort to rapidly develop and deploy effective and safe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations. Vaccination has been one of the most effective medical interventions in human history, although potential safety risks of novel vaccines must be monitored, identified, and quantified. Adverse events must be carefully assessed to define whether they are causally associated with vaccination or coincidence. Neurologic adverse events following immunizations are overall rare but with significant morbidity and mortality when they occur. Here, we review neurologic conditions seen in the context of prior vaccinations and the current data to date on select COVID-19 vaccines including mRNA vaccines and the adenovirus-vector COVID-19 vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2.S Johnson & Johnson (Janssen/J&J).",

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease have been reported to be associated with several neurological manifestations such as stroke, Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis amongst others. There are only a few reported cases of transverse myelitis with the novel coronavirus (n-CoV-2). Here, we identify a post COVID-19 vaccination patient diagnosed with acute transverse myelitis. METHOD: A retrospective chart review of a patient diagnosed with post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination acute transverse myelitis, and a review of literature of all the reported cases of other post vaccination and transverse myelitis, from December 1st, 2010 till July 15th, 2021, was performed. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the one of early reported case of transverse myelitis and with post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, who responded well to plasmapheresis. Further studies would be recommended to identify the underlying correlation between COVID-19 vaccination and transverse myelitis.",

We report a rare case of transverse myelitis following vaccination against COVID-19. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old male presented with progressive sensorimotor dysfunction of the bilateral lower limbs 7 days after receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine against COVID-19. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed intramedullary lesions with gadolinium enhancement on the Th1/2 and Th5/6 vertebral levels. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing showed a mildly increased level of total protein and positive oligoclonal bands (OCB). DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with acute transverse myelitis. INTERVENTION: The patient received 5 days of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse (1000 mg/day) followed by oral prednisolone (30 mg/day with gradual tapering). OUTCOMES: The patient fully recovered from muscle weakness of the lower limbs. He was discharged from our hospital and able to independently walk without unsteadiness. LESSON: This is a rare case of transverse myelitis following COVID-19 vaccination. Positive OCB in CSF in the present case highlights the possibility of autoimmune processes, including polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes, following vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a rare neurological condition (1.34-4.6 cases per million/year) COVID-19-associated ATM cases have occurred during the pandemic. CASE-FINDING METHODS: We report a patient from Panama with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by ATM and present a comprehensive clinical review of 43 patients with COVID-19-associated ATM from 21 countries published from March 2020 to January 2021. In addition, 3 cases of ATM were reported as serious adverse events during the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). RESULTS: All patients had typical features of ATM with acute onset of paralysis, sensory level and sphincter deficits due to spinal cord lesions demonstrated by imaging. There were 23 males (53%) and 20 females (47%) ranging from ages 21- to 73- years-old (mean age, 49 years), with two peaks at 29 and 58 years, excluding 3 pediatric cases. The main clinical manifestations were quadriplegia (58%) and paraplegia (42%). MRI reports were available in 40 patients; localized ATM lesions affected ≤3 cord segments (12 cases, 30%) at cervical (5 cases) and thoracic cord levels (7 cases); 28 cases (70%) had longitudinally-extensive ATM (LEATM) involving ≥4 spinal cord segments (cervicothoracic in 18 cases and thoracolumbar-sacral in 10 patients). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurred in 8 patients, mainly women (67%) ranging from 27- to 64-years-old. Three ATM patients also had blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO) and two more also had acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). CONCLUSIONS: We found ATM to be an unexpectedly frequent neurological complication of COVID-19. Most cases (68%) had a latency of 10 days to 6 weeks that may indicate post-infectious neurological complications mediated by the host's response to the virus. In 32% a brief latency (15 hours to 5 days) suggested a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2. The occurrence of 3 reported ATM adverse effects among 11,636 participants in the AZD1222 vaccine trials is extremely high considering a worldwide incidence of 0.5/million",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has started in December 2019, millions of people have been infected all over the world. Vaccination is the most efficient tool to end this pandemic, but vaccine surveillance is necessary to identify side effects. Some studies have shown that neurological complications after COVID-19 vaccination are rare and dominated by demyelinating disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 67-year-old man who presented 7 days following his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine a rapidly progressive ascending muscle weakness. The diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was confirmed according to the clinical features, the albumino-cytological dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the electroneuromyography findings. The workup for all known infections associated with immune-mediated GBS was negative. The patient received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Neurological examination 1 month after discharge showed full recovery and he regained his baseline functional status. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, this is the first reported case in Tunisia. Although extremely rare, neurologists should remain vigilant for acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy after",

      "Abstract": "Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare immune-mediated disorder of the peripheral nerves. Although its cause is not fully understood, the syndrome often follows infection with a virus or bacteria, although in rare occasions, vaccination may precede GBS. We describe a case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with paraesthesia and progressive weakness of both lower limbs over 3 days. Clinical examination and investigation findings including lumbar puncture and nerve conduction studies were consistent with the diagnosis of GBS. She had no history of either diarrhoea or respiratory tract infections preceding her presentation. However, she had her first intramuscular dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine 11 days prior to her presentation. Although no direct link could be ascertained, the purpose of this report is to highlight the incidence and consider this issue while evaluating any case of GBS in the light of the current pandemic and vaccination programme.",

We report three patients who developed Guillain-Barré syndrome following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, who did not have active or prior COVID-19 infection. The neurological illness in all patients had an onset of 11-13 days after the first dose of vaccine. All were characterized by sensorimotor weakness of the upper and lower limbs, with facial diplegia in one and dysautonomia in the other. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with demyelination in two and axonopathy in one. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed albuminocytological dissociation in two patients. All patients had moderate-to-severe disability. They were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, with stabilization of the disease. Proper monitoring and prompt reporting of such cases is required to ensure safety of the vaccine.",

      "Abstract": "As of April 22, 2021, around 1.5 million individuals in three districts of Kerala, India had been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines. Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid-March to mid-April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within 2 weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All seven patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4- to 10-fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in <20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

      "Abstract": "Efforts to combat the global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) range from adequate diagnostic testing and contract tracing to vaccination for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the United States alone, three vaccinations have been authorized for emergency use (EUA) or approved to prevent COVID-19. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine by Johnson and Johnson (New Brunswick, New Jersey) is the only adenovirus-based vaccine and deemed relatively effective and safe by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following its clinical trial. Since its introduction, the US FDA has placed a warning on the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) after more than 100 cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) were reported. Herein, we outline the hospital course of a generally healthy 49-year-old female who experienced an axonal form of GBS nine days after receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in late 2019. One of the vaccines approved against COVID-19 is the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech). CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 71-year-old man with no history of the SARS-CoV-2 infection or any recent viral or bacterial illnesses who presented with bilateral oculomotor palsy and limb ataxia after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. The diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) was established based on physical examination, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF), and positron emission tomography (PET). There was no evidence of other predisposing infectious or autoimmune factors, and the period from COVID-19 vaccination to the appearance of neurological symptoms was similar to that of other vaccines and preceding events, such as infection. CONCLUSION: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variants after COVID-19 vaccination are extremely rare. Note that more research is needed to establish an association between MFS and COVID-19 vaccines. In our opinion, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination largely outweigh its risks.",

      "Abstract": "The rollout of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is underway, and millions have already been vaccinated. At least 25 reports of \"immune thrombocytopenia\" (ITP) or \"thrombocytopenia\" following the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine have been added to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the US. ITP is a rare but known complication of several vaccinations. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is new, with a novel mechanism of action, and understanding the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, treatment success and natural history of post-vaccination thrombocytopenia is evolving. We report a 74-year-old man who developed refractory thrombocytopenia within one day of receiving the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Several hours after vaccination, he developed significant epistaxis and cutaneous purpura. Severe thrombocytopenia was documented the following day, and he developed extremity weakness and encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness. Over a 14-day period, thrombocytopenia was treated first with high dose dexamethasone, intravenous immunoglobulin, platelet transfusions, rituximab, plasma exchange (for presumed acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)), and four daily doses of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) eltrombopag (Promacta™), without a platelet response. Three days later, he received the TPO-RA romiplostim (Nplate™). Five days later, his platelet count began to rise and by",

      "Abstract": "A 77-year-old man with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted to the intensive care unit of Bangladesh Medical College Hospital with acute encephalopathy and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was on antidiabetic medicine along with H(2) blocker and multivitamins for his existing diseases. The patient's attendant reported that the patient had received his first dose of the Moderna coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine just 2 days ago. Physical examination revealed that he had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8/15; a pulse of 106 beats/min; a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min; oxygen saturation of 80% on room air, which became with 10 L of oxygen and blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg at the time of admission. During the hospital stay, the patient was treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and other necessary medication. Although we have observed the onset of encephalopathy and NSTEMI following COVID vaccination for this patient, we, as healthcare professionals, cannot directly attribute the cause of the complications to the Moderna vaccine without further epidemiological studies with large samples.",

      "Abstract": "SARS-COV-2 predominantly results in a respiratory illness. However, it has also been associated with a wide range of neurological disorders including a broad range of immune neuropathies. These immune neuropathies associated with SARS-COV2 infection include Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), recurrent GBS and exacerbation of pre-existing chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We describe a case with acute-onset CIDP presenting with three relapses of demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, the third relapse occurring in the 8 week of illness following a previous COVID-19 infection and a recent COVID-19 vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and high COVID-19 antibody level.

We recently observed a patient who developed a similar syndrome, later in the follow up he showed worsening of the neuropathy two months after the initial presentation. Repeat EMG showed reduced nerve sensory and motor conduction velocities of both upper and lower limbs, and a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (typical CIDP) was made according to established criteria. Our report expands on the possible outcomes in patients who develop Guillain-Barrè syndrome after COVID-19 vaccinations and suggest that close monitoring after the acute phase is needed in these patients to exclude a chronic evolution of the disease, which has important implications for long-term treatment.",

      "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the fastest-spreading pandemic of the 21st century. Various vaccines have been made available via emergency use authorization. Currently, two mRNA vaccines are being offered internationally, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. In randomized trials of these vaccines, the incidence of Bell's palsy in the vaccinated group does not statistically exceed the placebo group. The FDA recommends increased surveillance for Bell's palsy as a potential side effect with the administration of the vaccines among larger populations globally. There have been a few case reports of Bell's palsy associated with mRNA vaccines. Type I interferons have been proposed as the potential mechanism linking mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to Bell's palsy. Here, we report the case of a",

      "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the midst of the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic, active immunization by effective vaccination gained utmost importance in terms of global health. The messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are novel strategies requiring clinical surveillance for adverse events. CASE REPORT: We report a 43-year-old previously healthy female with an optic neuritis attack 24 hours following immunization with the second dose of coronavirus disease of 2019 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. A second transverse myelitis attack together with an elevated anti-AQP-4 antibody titer confirmed the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. CONCLUSION: Our case identifies the BNT162b2 vaccine as a possible trigger for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. This rare and potentially coincidental event has no implications for vaccine administration practices. However, further research is needed to elucidate the effects of mRNA vaccines on humoral and cell-mediated immunity.",

      "Abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is an autoimmune demyelinating disease with high relative prevalence in the East Asian population. Clinical manifestations include optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, area postrema syndrome, brainstem syndromes, and diencephalic syndromes. In this case report, we present a case of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder that developed 10 days after the first dose of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 mRNA-1273 vaccine. The patient was a previously healthy White female, completely independent and functional at baseline. She presented with bilateral lower-extremity numbness/tingling, weakness, and urinary retention. Although her neuromyelitis optica IgG was negative, the MRI was consistent with neuromyelitis optica involving and spanning longitudinally the C6-T2 vertebrae. She was treated with IV steroids and her symptoms improved. Given the novelty of the COVID-19 vaccines and the paucity of literature regarding their adverse effects, case reports such as ours provide unique information that aids healthcare providers in accurately diagnosing and treating patients, ultimately minimizing long-term neurologic deficits.",

      "Abstract": "The availability of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), provides hope towards mitigation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Vaccine safety and efficacy has not been established in individuals with chronic autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Anecdotal reports suggest that the vaccines may be associated with brain, spinal cord, peripheral nervous system, and cardiac inflammation. Based on the high morbidity and unpredictable course of COVID-19, and the need to achieve herd immunity, vaccination has been recommended for patients with MS. We report clinical and MRI features of seven individuals who received the Moderna (n = 3) or Pfizer (n = 4) SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Within one to 21 days of either the first (n = 2) or second (n = 5) vaccine dose, these patients developed neurologic symptoms and MRI findings consistent with active CNS demyelination of the optic nerve, brain, and/or spinal cord. Symptoms included visual loss, dysmetria, gait instability, paresthesias, sphincter disturbance, and limb weakness. Age ranged from 24 to 64 (mean 39.1) years; five were woman (71.4%). The final diagnosis was exacerbation of known stable MS (n = 4, two were receiving disease-modifying therapy at the time of vaccination), new onset MS (n = 2), or new onset neuromyelitis optica (n = 1). All responded to corticosteroid (n = 7) or plasma exchange (n = 1) therapy, with five returning to baseline and two approaching baseline. Large prospective studies are required to further investigate any possible relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and acute CNS demyelination.",

The patient received a diagnosis of MS in November 2016 at the MS Centre of the A. Cardarelli Hospital (South of Italy). Since that moment, her clinical conditions and pharmacological therapies have been managed at this MS centre where, according to national recommendations, in April 2021, the patient received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Almost 48 h after receiving the vaccine, the patient developed paraesthesia and weakness in her left arm and limbs. The neurological examination revealed walking difficulties while the MRI showed three new voluminous enhancing lesions. After having received methylprednisolone iv for 5 days, the patient's neurological symptoms fully recovered. Along with the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination programmes among vulnerable population, further studies are needed in order to improve our knowledge on the benefit/risk ratio of COVID-19 vaccines.",

CASE REPORT We describe a case of 56-year-old postmenopausal, obese woman with hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with fluctuating mental status and left-side weakness for 5 days. She received her first and second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) at 12 and 8 weeks, respectively, prior to presentation. She was found to have multiple hemorrhages and infarcts on a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. She was intubated in the ED for airway protection and mechanically ventilated. Magnetic resonance angiogram and venogram showed multiple infarcts in right frontal, parietal, and left parietal lobes, along with occlusion of left-side transverse sinus, sagittal sinuses, and left internal jugular vein, suggesting cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Despite anticoagulation, her clinical condition continued to worsen, and she was referred for emergent endovascular thrombectomy. Her clinical condition improved after thrombectomy, and she was discharged on warfarin. At",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (VI-CVST) is a rare complication in recipients of the adenovirus-vectored coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Vaxzevria®; AstraZeneca). OBJECTIVES: Development of a diagnostic and therapeutic standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of clinical and basic research findings, expert opinions, and experience with our own cases. RESULTS: VI-CVST usually manifests on day 4-24 after vaccination, mostly in individuals aged < 60 years, and women. In the majority there is an immune pathogenesis caused by antibodies against platelet factor 4/polyanion complexes, leading to thrombotic thrombocytopenia which can result in severe, sometimes fatal, course. The cardinal symptom is headache worsening within days which, however, also can be of variable intensity. Other possible symptoms are seizures, visual disturbance, focal neurological deficits and signs of increased intracranial pressure. If VI-CVST is suspected, the determination of plasma D‑dimer level, platelet count, and screening for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT-2) are essential for treatment decision-making. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with venous MR-angiography is the neuroimaging modality of choice to confirm or exclude VI-CVST. On T2* susceptibility-weighted MRI, the clot in the sinuses or veins produces marked susceptibility artifacts (\"blooming\"), which also enables the detection of isolated cortical venous thromboses.

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has been described after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical characteristics of 213 post-vaccination CVST cases notified to the European Medicines Agency are reported. METHODS: Data on adverse drug reactions after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination notified until 8 April 2021 under the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Term 'Central nervous system vascular disorders' were obtained from the EudraVigilance database. Post-vaccination CVST was compared with 100 European patients with CVST from before the COVID-19 pandemic derived from the International CVST Consortium. RESULTS: In all, 213 CVST cases were identified: 187 after AstraZeneca/Oxford (ChAdOx1 nCov-19) vaccination and 26 after a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (25 with Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2, and one with Moderna, mRNA-1273). Thrombocytopenia was reported in 107/187 CVST cases (57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 50%-64%) in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group, in none in the mRNA vaccine group (0%, 95% CI 0%-13%) and in 7/100 (7%, 95% CI 3%-14%) in the pre-COVID-19 group. In the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group, 39 (21%) reported COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction tests were performed within 30 days of CVST symptom onset, and all were negative. Of the 117 patients with a reported outcome in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group, 44 (38%, 95% CI 29%-47%) had died, compared to 2/10 (20%, 95% CI 6%-51%) in the mRNA vaccine group and 3/100 (3%, 95% CI 1%-8%) in the",

Cerebral venous thrombosis is the most common manifestation of this syndrome but, to our knowledge, has not previously been described in detail. We aimed to document the features of post-vaccination cerebral venous thrombosis with and without VITT and to assess whether VITT is associated with poorer outcomes. METHODS: For this multicentre cohort study, clinicians were asked to submit all cases in which COVID-19 vaccination preceded the onset of cerebral venous thrombosis, regardless of the type of vaccine, interval between vaccine and onset of cerebral venous thrombosis symptoms, or blood test results.

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare complication following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is overrepresented in VITT and is often associated with multifocal venous thromboses, concomitant hemorrhage and poor outcomes. Hitherto, endovascular treatments have not been reviewed in VITT-related CVST. METHODS: Patient records from a tertiary neurosciences center were reviewed to identify patients who had endovascular treatment for CVST in VITT. RESULTS: Patient records from 1 January 2021 to 20 July 2021 identified three patients who underwent endovascular treatment for CVST in the context of VITT. All were female and the median age was 52 years. The location of the CVST was highly variable.",

METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was e-mailed to all departments of neurology. We requested a report of cases of CVT occurring within 1 month of a COVID-19 vaccination. Other cerebral events could also be reported. Incidence rates of CVT were calculated by using official statistics of 9 German states. RESULTS: A total of 45 CVT cases were reported. In addition, 9 primary ischemic strokes, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhages, and 4 other neurological events were recorded. Of the CVT patients, 35 (77.8%) were female, and 36 (80.0%) were younger than 60 years.",

      "Abstract": "Recently cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and thrombosis following the adenoviral vector vaccine against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported. A mechanism similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was proposed with antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4). Vaccine related arterial thrombosis in the brain is rare but life-threatening and optimal treatment is not established. We report clinical, laboratory, imaging findings and treatment in a 51-year-old female presenting with acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion 7 days after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Due to low platelet count and suspicion of VITT she was not eligible for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and proceeded to mechanical thrombectomy (MER) with successful recanalization four hours after onset of symptoms. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux was initiated. Presence of anti-PF4 antibodies was confirmed. The patient improved clinically with normalization of platelet count. Clinicians should be alert of VITT in patients with acute ischemic stroke after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination and low platelet counts. MER showed to be feasible and effective. We propose considering MER in patients with VITT and large vessel occlusion despite thrombocytopenia. High-dose IVIG should be started immediately. Alternative anticoagulation to heparin should be started 24 hours after stroke onset unless significant hemorrhagic transformation occurred. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated and should be considered only in severe hemorrhagic complications. Restenosis or reocclusion of the revascularized artery is possible due to the hypercoagulable state in VITT and angiographic surveillance after the procedure is reasonable.",

Even if the first dosage goes uncomplicated, the second dose may be complicated by severe adverse reactions as in the following case. CASE REPORT: A 52yo male developed sudden-onset reading difficulty and aphasia 7d after the second dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. He had a previous history of myocardial infarction, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nephrolithiasis. Blood pressure was slightly elevated on admission. Blood tests revealed mildly elevated D-dimer, pre-diabetes and hyperuricemia. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intracerebral bleeding (ICB) in the left temporal lobe. Aphasia resolved almost completely within a few days. Blood pressure values were normal throughout hospitalisation. Whether there was a causal relation between the ICB and the vaccination remains speculative but cannot be definitively excluded. CONCLUSIONS: A second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be followed by ICB. Though the pathophysiology of ICB remains unexplained a causal relation between ICB and the vaccination cannot be excluded. Risk factors for ICB should be carefully monitored in patients undergoing",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) due to acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the largest emergency that humanity had to be dealing with in the last century. During the last months, different types of vaccines have been designed to contain the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with successful results in many countries. Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNtech) COVID-19 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside mRNA vaccine encoding the prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Although vaccines have an undeniable efficacy, they can also present several neurological side effects, including headache. According to ICHD-3 Classification, status migrainosus (SMg) is described as a debilitating migraine attack lasting for more than 72 h. Symptoms of SMg can be very severe, preventing the normal daily activities of the individual. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present report, we describe a case of SMg that lasted 11 days, time correlated with the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer/Comirnaty) in a 37-year-old woman with a history of migraine without aura. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a history of migraine, COVID-19 vaccination could lead to a worsening of headache and, in rare cases, to the development of a SMg. This may be related to the inflammatory response that occurs after vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes the infectious disease COVID-19. Newly developed mRNA vaccines can prevent the spread of the virus. Headache is the most common neurological symptom in over 50% of those vaccinated. Detailed information about the clinical characteristics of this form of headache has not yet been described. The aim of the study is to examine in detail the clinical characteristics of headaches occurring after vaccination against COVID-19 with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for the first time. In a multicentre observational cohort study, data on the clinical features and corresponding variables were recorded using a standardized online questionnaire. The questionnaire was circulated to 12 000 residential care homes of the elderly as well as tertiary university hospitals in Germany and the United Arab Emirates. The primary outcomes of this study are the clinical features of headache after vaccination. Comorbidities, treatment with medication and sociodemographic variables are also analysed. A total of 2349 participants reported headaches after vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Headaches occur an average of 18.0 ± 27.0 h after vaccination and last an average duration of 14.2 ± 21.3 h. Only 9.7% of those affected also report headaches resulting from previous vaccinations. In 66.6% of the participants, headache occurs as a single episode. A bilateral location is indicated by 73.1% of the participants. This is most often found on the forehead (38.0%) and temples (32.1%). A pressing pain character is indicated by 49.2% and 40.7% report a dull pain character. The pain intensity is most often moderate (46.2%), severe (32.1%) or very severe (8.2%). The most common accompanying symptoms are fatigue (38.8%), exhaustion (25.7%) and muscle pain (23.4%). Headaches after COVID-19 vaccination show an extensive complex of symptoms. The constellation of accompanying symptoms together with the temporal and spatial headache characteristics delimit a distinctive headache phenotype.",

      "Abstract": "The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has contributed to more than 163 million confirmed infections and 3.3 million deaths worldwide. The severity of the pandemic has led to an unprecedented effort to develop multiple effective vaccines. Due to excellent safety and efficacy data from clinical trials, several vaccines were approved. We report a case series of postvaccinal encephalitis in temporal correlation to vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. The diagnostic criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis were fulfilled. Our patients responded well to immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids. The incidence has been estimated to be approximately 8 per 10 million vaccine doses. Complication of postvaccinal encephalitis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination still appear to be very rare, but need to be diagnosed and treated adequately. Large pooled data from observational epidemiologic studies are necessary to verify causality. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:506-511.",

We report the first known case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis after SARS-CoV-2 immunization in a young female presenting with acute psychosis, highlighting a rare potential immunological complication of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 that is currently being distributed worldwide. The patient presented initially with anxiety and hypochondriacal delusions which progressed to psychosis and catatonia but returned to baseline with aggressive immunomodulatory therapy consisting of intravenous immunoglobulin, high-dose glucocorticoids, and rituximab. This study highlights that the workup of acute psychosis should include establishing a history of recent vaccination followed by a thorough neurological assessment, including for anti-NMDAR antibodies in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.",

      "Abstract": "We present the acute worsening of clinical presentation in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), following mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination. We report the case series of three patients diagnosed with CRPS type I who presented with acute worsening of symptoms after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination and their medical management. The acute clinical worsening after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination was transient and effectively managed with adjustment of individualized therapy in all three patients. The mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 infection are serious, and vaccination is recommended in the general population, including patients with a diagnosis of CRPS. However, clinicians should be aware of the possibility that there may be a clinical worsening CRPS after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "Although vaccination against Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is still occurring, several adverse effects temporally related to these vaccines are already being reported, even if through isolated case reports. In the present study, we describe the lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of three patients who developed neurological symptoms after receiving the ChAdOX1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca). The first patient presented with an ischemic stroke in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule, two days after vaccination. The second patient presented with a left facial nerve palsy, seven days after vaccination. The third patient presented with myelitis, eight days after receiving the vaccine. All patients presented the symptoms after the first dose of the vaccine and did not have a history of previous COVID-19. The real incidence of these types of complications is not known yet, but it is important to consider the possibility of COVID-19 vaccine complications, in patients with a recent history of vaccination and recent development of neurological symptoms, even though this association is only casual. Longitudinal studies are necessary to further analyze the incidence of the adverse effects of each vaccine against",

We report the case of a 66-year-old male patient with a history of allergies. Five hours after his vaccination with the anti-COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca), he developed acute respiratory distress. The biological assessment showed hyperleukocytosis, 20% of which are eosinophils. Diagnosis of severe postvaccination acute eosinophilic pneumonia was retained given the history of allergy, lack of improvement on antibiotics, elimination of all other probable causes of eosinophilia, and improvement on corticosteroids. Such reactions of eosinophilic pneumonia have only been described twice: once following vaccination with the influenza vaccine (Vaxigrip*) and the other after vaccination with the",

Multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed in a rapid timeframe to combat the pandemic. While generally safe and effective, rare cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported after two adenovirus-based vaccines, the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and the Janssen Ad.26.COV2.S vaccine, as well as after the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

      "Abstract": "Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequent cause of hypoxemic respiratory failure and presentation to the emergency department. The incidence is on the increase since the COVID-19 outbreak. While COVID infection represents a prothrombotic state, the introduction of COVID vaccines to a lesser extent increased the risk of unprovoked venous thrombus formation and risk of pulmonary embolism. PE is mostly associated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and only a few cases of isolated or De novo PE exist in literature. We report two cases of isolated PE associated with COVID-19 vaccinations. We aimed to highlight the need to suspect isolated PE in patients presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure days to several weeks following COVID-19 vaccination and emphasize the importance of post-discharge follow-up for evaluating chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).",

Many questions have since been raised surrounding the safety of the vaccines, and a lot of media attention to certain side effects. This caused a state of vaccine hesitancy that may prove problematic in the global effort to control the virus. This review was undertaken with the aim of putting together all the reported cardiovascular and haematological events post COVID-19 vaccination in published literature and to suggest possible mechanisms to explain these rare phenomena.",

      "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has affected human lives across the globe. On 11 December 2020, the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for the first COVID-19 vaccine, and vaccines are now widely available. Undoubtedly, the emergence of these vaccines has led to substantial relief, helping alleviate the fear and anxiety around the COVID-19 illness for both the general public and clinicians. However, recent cases of vaccine complications, including myopericarditis, have been reported after administration of COVID-19 vaccines. This article discusses the cases, possible pathogenesis of myopericarditis, and treatment of the condition. Most cases were mild and should not yet change vaccine policies, although prospective studies are needed to better assess the risk-benefit ratios in different groups.",

An additional 87,000 people have been vaccinated with vaccines in World Health Organization's Emergency Use Listing. The aim of this review is to explore the reported cardiac adverse events associated with different types of COVID-19 vaccines. 42 studies that reported cardiac side effects after COVID-19 vaccination were included in this study. Reported COVID-19 vaccine-associated cardiac adverse events were mainly myocarditis and pericarditis, most commonly seen in adolescent and young adult male individuals after mRNA vaccination. Reports of other events such as acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and stress cardiomyopathy were rare. Outcomes of post-vaccine myocarditis and pericarditis were good. Given the good vaccine efficacy and the high number of cases of infection, hospitalisation and death that could potentially be prevented, COVID-19 vaccine remains of overall benefit, based on the current available data.",

These have mostly occurred in young males after the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVES: Fulminant necrotising eosinophilic myocarditis triggered by a variety of drugs or vaccines is an extremely rare hypersensitivity reaction carrying a substantial mortality risk.

Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and Impella support were essential in achieving hemodynamic stability. Endomyocardial biopsy revealed lymphocytic infiltration with predominant immunostaining for CD8- and CD68-positive cells. The left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly after treatment with mechanical circulatory support. Myocarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination may also occur in middle-aged women; it may be fulminant and require mechanical circulatory support. Although our results suggest the involvement of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages, further investigation is needed before these can be established as pathogenetic mechanisms.",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaccines are paramount in the effort to end the coronavirus disease 2019 global epidemic. BNT162b2 is approved for the vaccination of adolescents over 16 years of age. Systemic adverse events were scarce though the pretested cohort of this age group was relatively small. The aim of the current study is to raise awareness for potential adverse reactions. METHODS: This is a case series of patients diagnosed with perimyocarditis following vaccination. Patients were compiled from 3 pediatric medical centers in Israel through a network of pediatricians and data regarding those cases was collected. In addition, incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was compared with previous years. RESULTS: All patients were males 16-18 years old, of Jewish descent, who presented with chest pain that began 1-3 days following vaccination (mean, 2.1 days). In 6 of the 7 patients, symptoms began following the 2nd dose and in 1 patient following the 1st dose. All cases were mild and none required cardiovascular or respiratory support. The incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was elevated in comparison to previous years. CONCLUSIONS: This case series describes a time association between coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine and perimyocarditis in adolescents. All cases were mild, although only",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In May 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the Emergency Use Authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine (BNT162b2) to include adolescents 12-15 years of age. As vaccine administration continues to increase, potential adverse outcomes, to include myocarditis, are being reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. CASE REPORT: This case report describes a 17-year-old male patient who developed focal myocarditis mimicking an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) 3 days after administration of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Myocarditis is a rare complication in adolescents receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Focal myocarditis may demonstrate localizing electrocardiographic changes consistent with a STEMI. Overall, complications of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are extremely rare. The vaccine continues to be recommended by public health experts, as the benefits of vaccinations greatly outweigh the rare side effects.",

      "Abstract": "Myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination has recently been reported to health authorities in the United States and other countries. Cases predominately occur in young adult males within four days following the second dose of either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Although the number of cases reported have been small in comparison with the large number of people vaccinated, myocarditis may be a rare adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccination that is now only becoming apparent due to the widespread use of the vaccine. In this article, we present a case of a 20-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. He had received the BNT162b2 vaccine two days prior to his presentation to the ED. The patient had an elevated troponin at 89 ng/L which increased on repeat examination. His electrocardiogram showed diffuse concave ST segment elevations and a later MRI confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis. The patient had a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 approximately two months prior to the onset of his symptoms, but since he had fully recovered before the time of his presentation to the ED, it is unlikely that the infection caused the myocarditis. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of myocarditis following BNT162b3 vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "Myopericarditis following mRNA Covid-19 vaccination has recently been reported to health authorities in a lot of countries. They can occur in very rare cases after either the Moderna (mRNA-1273 - Spikevax) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2 - Comirnaty) vaccination. Cases predominately occur in younger adult men within 14 days following the second dose. In this article, we present a 56 year-old man with no prior medical history, whit the exception of a mild Covid-19 infection 4 months earlier, who experienced an episode of acute epigastric pain, profuse sweating, tachycardia, hypotension 4 days after the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Troponin I level was elevated. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, coronary angiography didn't show significant abnormalities. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance showed a pattern of acute myocarditis. The condition appeared to be self-limited and the patient recovered without specific therapy. No report of acute myocarditis was observed in the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 trials and very rare cases, in comparison to given doses, have been reported to pharmacovigilance systems worldwide. Further surveillance and evaluation of this side effect are warranted to establish the correct balance of benefits and risks of Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, above all in children and younger people (categories with the higher reactogenicity and the lower risk of Covid-19 complications). At the present time the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination significantly exceed possible risks.",

According to the reports so far, myocarditis related to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination is rare and usually associated with a benign clinical course without intensive care or any sequelae of fulminant myocarditis. Here, we report a case of acute fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock after the mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, requiring extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Clinicians should keep in mind the possibility of progression to fulminant myocarditis in patients who presented with suggestive symptoms or signs of myocarditis after the COVID-19 vaccination.",

We report a case of an elderly man who presented with acute-onset chest pain after three months of receiving the second dose of the mRNA vaccine. He was found to have acute myocarditis on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), which was attributed to exposure to the COVID-19 vaccine in the absence of any other risk factors. Our patient demonstrated quick resolution of symptoms and was discharged within 72 hours. We review the literature and summarize published case reports on",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Half of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccines produced by either Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson and Johnson, which represents a major milestone in the ongoing pandemic. Given the emergency use authorizations for these vaccines, their side effects and safety were assessed over a compressed time period. Hence, ongoing monitoring for vaccine-related adverse events is imperative for a full understanding and delineation of their safety profile. CASE PRESENTATION: An 22-year-old Caucasian male presented to our hospital center complaining of pleuritic chest pain. Six months prior he had a mild case of COVID-19, but was otherwise healthy. He had received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine three days prior to developing symptoms. Laboratory analysis revealed a markedly elevated troponin and multiple imaging modalities during his hospitalization found evidence of wall motion abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of perimyocarditis. He was started on aspirin and colchicine with marked improvement of his symptoms prior to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of perimyocarditis that was temporally related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in an young male with prior COVID-19 infection but otherwise healthy. Our case report highlights an albeit rare but important adverse event for clinicians to be aware of. It also suggests a possible mechanism for the development of myocardial injury in our patient.",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Since Emergency Use Authorization of COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020, more is becoming known about their adverse effects. Growing numbers of myopericarditis cases after COVID-19 vaccination are being reported, mostly in younger adults. While most of these patients have recovered rapidly and without complications, it is still unclear whether patients who are older and have greater cardiac dysfunction secondary to myopericarditis will also experience the same recovery. CASE REPORT We report the case of a middle-aged man with myopericarditis and significant left ventricular dysfunction after the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. He presented several days after vaccination, and with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment, he quickly recovered ventricular function, and symptoms resolved within 1 week after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Vaccines are a key tool in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, yet many people are hesitant to seek vaccination, perhaps for fear of adverse events. Our report of a middle-aged patient with significant left ventricular dysfunction, who still experienced rapid recovery, should reassure the public about the safety of vaccines. Such rare adverse effects should not deter people from receiving COVID-19 vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "Increasing rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination coverage will result in more vaccine-related side effects, including acute myocarditis. In Korea, we present a 24-year-old male with acute myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination (BNT162b2). His chest pain developed the day after vaccination and cardiac biomarkers were elevated. Echocardiography showed minimal pericardial effusion but normal myocardial contractility. Electrocardiography revealed diffuse ST elevation in lead II, and V2-5. Cardiac magnetic resonance images showed the high signal intensity of T2- short tau inversion recovery image, the high value of T2 mapping sequence, and late gadolinium enhancement in basal inferior and inferolateral wall. It was presumed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was probably responsible for acute myocarditis. Clinical course of the patient was favorable and he was discharged without any adverse event.",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine are known to cause minor side effects at the injection site and mild global systemic symptoms in first 24-48 h. Recently published case series have reported a possible association between acute myocarditis and COVID-19 vaccination, predominantly in young males. METHODS: We report a case series of 5 young male patients with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-confirmed acute myocarditis within 72 h after receiving a dose of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Our case series suggests that myocarditis in this setting is characterized by myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement in the lateral wall of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium, reduced global LV longitudinal strain, and preserved LV ejection fraction. All patients in our series remained clinically stable during a relatively short inpatient hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with other recently published case series and national vaccine safety surveillance data, this case series suggests a possible association between acute myocarditis and COVID-19 vaccination in young males and highlights a potential pattern in accompanying CMR abnormalities.",

      "Abstract": "Cardiovascular complications following the receipt of mRNA-based (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have not yet been described. In this case series, we describe two patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, one patient with stress cardiomyopathy, and two patients with pericarditis after receiving an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. The two patients with clinically suspected myocarditis were otherwise healthy young men who presented with acute substernal chest pressure and/or dyspnea after receiving the second dose of the vaccine and were found to have diffuse ST elevations on electrocardiogram (ECG), elevated cardiac biomarkers and inflammatory markers, and mildly reduced left ventricular (LV) function on echocardiography. Both patients met the modified Lake Louise Criteria for acute myocarditis by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We subsequently discuss a case of a 60-year-old woman with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and previously normal LV function, who presented with new exertional symptoms, ECG changes, and apical akinesis following the second dose of the vaccine, and was diagnosed with a stress cardiomyopathy. Finally, we describe two patients with pericarditis who presented with chest pain, elevated inflammatory markers, and pericardial effusions after receiving the vaccine. Overall, this case series describes the first reported cases of myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, and pericarditis after receiving an",

Rare adverse events including myocarditis have been reported in the literature. METHODS: Data were gathered from the electronic medical record of four patients personally treated by the authors. RESULTS: Four patients, ages 20 to 30, presented with myocarditis characterized by chest pain, elevations in troponin-I and C-reactive protein, and negative viral serologies two to four days following mRNA vaccine administration. One had a cardiac MRI showing delayed gadolinium enhancement in a subpericardial pattern. All experienced symptom resolution by the following day, and the two who have returned for follow-up had normal",

      "Abstract": "Adverse consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination which have been reported in scientific papers are varied. One possible but rare consequence is myocarditis, which may have a diversity of clinical manifestations. We report a case of a 70-year-old man who presented to the hospital for some syncope, 3 days after his first COVID-19 AstraZeneca Vaccination. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a long QT interval (QTc = 600 milliseconds). Laboratory tests revealed elevated troponin and lack of evidence of viral infection. Further investigations revealed the vaccine-induced myocarditis and arrhythmias linked to it. Within one week of magnesium treatment, the QT interval was completely corrected, and the patient discharged with no typical syncope attacks. This case like the previous reported one confirms that myocarditis is a complication of COVID-19 vaccine, but implies its clinical manifestations may be varied and even may happen after the single dose of vaccination.",

Herein we report a rare case of cardiovascular complication following Covishield vaccination in a 33 years old female who had dizziness and elevated blood pressure immediately following vaccination and abnormal electrocardiogram showing T wave inversions followed by left bundle branch block. The patient was kept on observation, following which the blood pressure and electrocardiogram changes were normal by seven days. This cardiovascular complication following the vaccination demands further investigation into the adverse event of the vaccine. However, since the benefit of the vaccine outweighs the risk, World Health Organization has recommended the continuity of the vaccine as of now.",

Recently developed genetically engineered vaccines are the most critical solution for controlling the pandemic. Clinical trials on a large number of participants confirmed their safety and efficacy. However, with the growing number of vaccinated people, new infrequent adverse effects have been reported, not described in the medicinal product characteristics. We would like to report a case of acute pancreatic injury that occurred shortly after administering Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty). The report points out the potential need for close monitoring of patients reporting abdominal pain after vaccination (unresponsive to standard oral painkillers) because such symptom can be associated with acute pancreatitis.",

Thrombotic events have been reported as a rare side effect after ChAdox1nCOV-19 vaccination that may cause death of recipient. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of hepatic artery occlusion after the first dose vaccination by ChAdOx1nCov-19. The patient was a health care worker, aged 34-year old. Past medical history was unremarkable and had not used heparin. Over the next couple of days after the vaccination, he reported headache, nausea, and dizziness as well as abdominal pain. His general status and the laboratories studies deteriorate quickly by increasing liver enzymes and severe coagulopathy. Clinically he had presented acute hepatic failure. He had been received blood products, prednisolone pulse along with broad antibiotics without benefit. He died on the sixth day. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombotic events after vaccination is very rare but can develop in main arteries with lethal outcome. This event may mimic autoimmune thrombosis clinically.",

      "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been reported to trigger several autoimmune diseases. There are also recent reports of autoimmune diseases that develop after SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Autoimmune hepatitis is a polygenic multifactorial disease, which is diagnosed using a scoring system. A 61-year-old woman presented with malaise, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and yellow eyes. She had a Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine a month ago. Her physical examination revealed jaundice all over the body, especially in the sclera. The laboratory tests showed elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. Antinuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody were positive and immunoglobulin G was markedly elevated. The liver biopsy revealed histopathological findings consistent with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The patient was diagnosed with AIH and initiated on steroid therapy. She rapidly responded to steroid therapy. A few cases of AIH have been reported after the",

      "Abstract": "Unprecedented loss of life due to the COVID pandemic has necessitated the development of several vaccines in record time. Most of these vaccines have received approval without being extensively whetted for their adverse effect and efficacy profiles. Most adverse effects have been mild, nonetheless, more serious thromboembolic events have also been reported. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) can occur in predisposed individuals where an immune mediated reaction against hepatocytes is triggered by environmental factors. Vaccines are a very rare cause of AIH. We report two such cases of AIH triggered by COVID (Covishield) vaccination. While one patient made an uneventful recovery, another succumbed to the liver disease. Ours is the first report of Covishield vaccination related AIH and second ever after any form of COVID vaccination. We hope that our report does not deter COVID vaccination drives. However, we also hope to raise awareness of its potential side effects and the increased role of pharmacovigilance in guiding treatment.",

We describe the case of an elderly woman who developed anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis with pulmonary renal syndrome approximately 3 weeks after the first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (Moderna). Her nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test for the COVID-19 RNA virus was negative. Gross hematuria, heavy proteinuria, acute renal failure (serum creatinine up to 6.5 mg/dL), and hemoptysis coupled with a marked increase in serum anti-myeloperoxidase-O antibody were observed. Renal biopsy showed severe vasculitis with pauci-immune crescent glomerulonephritis. The pulmonary hemorrhage was resolved and renal function improved following combined plasma exchange and the administration of systemic steroids and",

      "Abstract": "We report on the development of minimal change disease (MCD) with nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney injury (AKI), shortly after first injection of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). A 50-year-old previously healthy man was admitted to our hospital following the appearance of peripheral edema. Ten days earlier, he had received the first injection of the vaccine. Four days after injection, he developed lower leg edema, which rapidly progressed to anasarca. On admission, serum creatinine was 2.31 mg/dL and 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 6.9 grams. As kidney function continued to decline over the next days, empirical treatment was initiated with prednisone 80 mg/d. A kidney biopsy was performed and the findings were consistent with MCD. Ten days later, kidney function began to improve, gradually returning to normal. The clinical triad of MCD, nephrotic syndrome, and AKI has been previously described under a variety of circumstances, but not following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The association between the vaccination and MCD is at this time temporal and by exclusion, and by no means firmly established. We await further reports of similar cases to evaluate the true incidence of this possible vaccine side effect.",

      "Abstract": "RATIONALE: While severe complications are generally uncommon with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, there has been a steady increase in the number of patients presenting with nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney injury after the administration of COVID-19 vaccine. Physicians should be made aware of minimal change disease as a potential complication associated with COVID-19 vaccine. PRESENTING CONCERNS: A 60-year-old male without significant past medical history presented with new onset of nephrotic syndrome approximately 10 days after his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Laboratory findings showed hypoalbuminemia (20 g/L), elevated urine albumin/creatinine ratio (668 mg/mmol), and elevated creatinine of 116 µmol/L from a baseline of 79 µmol/L. DIAGNOSIS: A diagnostic kidney biopsy was performed 6 weeks after the onset of the edema and approximately 8 weeks after his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech",

Here, we report a 51-year-old healthy man with nephrotic syndrome secondary to minimal change disease (MCD) after Ad26.COV.2 (Janssen) vaccination. He had no comorbid disease and received Ad26.COV.2 on April 13, 2021. Seven days after vaccination, he developed edema and foamy urine. Edema rapidly aggravated with decreased urine volume. He was admitted to the hospital 28 days after vaccination, and his body weight increased by 21 kg after vaccination. His serum creatinine level was 1.54 mg/dL, and 24-h urinary protein excretion was 8.6 g/day. Kidney biopsy revealed no abnormality in the glomeruli and interstitium of the cortex and medulla under the light microscope. Electron microscopy revealed diffuse effacement of the podocyte foot processes, thus, he was diagnosed with MCD. High-dose steroid therapy was applied, and his kidney function improved three days after steroid therapy. Three weeks after steroid use, his serum creatinine decreased to 0.95 mg/dL, and spot urine",

      "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is more effective than traditional vaccines owing to superior immune activation. Nevertheless, the impact of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine on triggering de novo/relapsing glomerulonephritis (GN) is limited. We report a case series of patients who developed new or relapsing GN postvaccination. METHODS: We evaluated baseline characteristics, vaccine type, and clinical outcomes of 13 patients from our institution who had a new diagnosis or relapse of their GN post-mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Of 13 patients, 8 patients were newly diagnosed with having GN and 5 patients had relapse. Median age was 62 years (range 19-83 years). Autoimmune disease (38%) was the most prevalent underlying disease followed by cancer (23%). Most patients were White males. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was the most common GN in our series (5 patients, 38%) followed by membranous nephropathy (MN) (3 patients, 23%). There was 1 patient with IgAN who had evidence of IgA deposits before vaccination suggesting the immune activation after vaccination triggered a flare of the disease. Our case series also included the first case report of tip-variant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), NELL-1-associated MN, and atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis. A total of 77% developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with most being Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 1 (67%). Outcomes are favorable with 80% responding to therapy. CONCLUSION: New cases and relapse of GN can present shortly after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. New cases of IgAN may result from unmasking of undiagnosed IgAN owing to robust immune activation rather than development of new deposits.",

      "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is more effective than traditional vaccines owing to superior immune activation. Nevertheless, the impact of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine on triggering de novo/relapsing glomerulonephritis (GN) is limited. We report a case series of patients who developed new or relapsing GN postvaccination. METHODS: We evaluated baseline characteristics, vaccine type, and clinical outcomes of 13 patients from our institution who had a new diagnosis or relapse of their GN post-mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Of 13 patients, 8 patients were newly diagnosed with having GN and 5 patients had relapse. Median age was 62 years (range 19-83 years). Autoimmune disease (38%) was the most prevalent underlying disease followed by cancer (23%). Most patients were White males. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was the most common GN in our series (5 patients, 38%) followed by membranous nephropathy (MN) (3 patients, 23%). There was 1 patient with IgAN who had evidence of IgA deposits before vaccination suggesting the immune activation after vaccination triggered a flare of the disease. Our case series also included the first case report of tip-variant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), NELL-1-associated MN, and atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis. A total of 77% developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with most being Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 1 (67%). Outcomes are favorable with 80% responding to therapy. CONCLUSION: New cases and relapse of GN can present shortly after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. New cases of IgAN may result from unmasking of undiagnosed IgAN owing to robust immune activation rather than development of new deposits.",

      "Abstract": "A 28-year-old woman experienced gross hematuria after the administration of the second dose of an messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine (BNT162b2). She was diagnosed with Immunogloblin A nephropathy (IgAN) by a renal biopsy two weeks after vaccination, which revealed a mild increase in mesangial cells and a matrix with co-depositions of galactose-deficient IgA1 and C3 in the mesangial region. The gross hematuria and proteinuria gradually improved without any medication, suggesting that immune activation by the mRNA vaccine may not elicit continuous disease progression of IgAN. Thus, further studies investigating the relationship between mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and the progression of IgAN should be conducted.",

      "Abstract": "We report on the development of nephrotic proteinuria and microhematuria, with histological features of renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), following the first dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and COVID-19 diagnosis. A 35-year-old previously healthy man was admitted at our hospital due to the onset of foamy urine. Previously, 40 days earlier, he had received the first injection of the vaccine, and 33 days earlier, the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. Laboratory tests showed nephrotic proteinuria (7.9 gr/day), microhematuria, serum creatinine 0.91 mg/dL. Kidney biopsy revealed ultrastructural evidence of severe endothelial cell injury suggestive of a starting phase of TMA. After high-dose steroid treatment administration, complete remission of proteinuria was achieved in a few weeks. The association of COVID-19 with renal TMA has been previously described only in patients with acute renal injury. Besides, the correlation with COVID-19 vaccine has not been reported so far. The close temporal proximity (7 days) between the two events opens the question whether the histological findings should be ascribed to COVID-19 itself or to vaccine injection.",

      "Abstract": "Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were launched in December 2020. Vaccination of patients with rheumatic diseases is recommended, as they are considered at higher risk of severe COVID-19 than the general population. Patients with rheumatic disease have largely been excluded from vaccine phase 3 trials. This study explores the safety and reactogenicity of BNT162b2 among patients with rheumatic diseases. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), median age 58.8 years, 285 subjects in total, were vaccinated twice with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech). Questionnaires on reactogenicity matching the original phase 3 study were answered seven days after completed vaccination. The majority of SLE and RA patients experienced either local (78.0%) or systemic reactions (80.1%). Only 1.8% experienced a grade-4 reaction. Compared to the original study, we found more frequent fatigue [Odds ratio (OR) 2.2 (1.7-2.8)], headache [OR 1.7 (1.3-2.2)], muscle pain [OR 1.8 (1.4-2.3)], and joint pain [OR 2.3 (1.7-3.0)] in patients. In contrast, the use of antipyretics was less frequent [OR 0.5 (0.3-0.6)]. Patients with SLE and RA experience reactogenicity to the",

      "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate disease flare and postvaccination reactions (reactogenicity) in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) following 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination. METHODS: RMD patients (n = 1,377) who received 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination between December 16, 2020 and April 15, 2021 completed questionnaires detailing local and systemic reactions experienced within 7 days of each vaccine dose (dose 1 and dose 2), and 1 month after dose 2, detailing any flares of RMD. Associations between demographic/clinical characteristics and flares requiring treatment were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among the patients, 11% reported flares requiring treatment; there were no reports of severe flares. Flares were associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.09, P = 0.02), flares in the 6 months preceding vaccination (IRR 2.36, P < 0.001), and the use of combination immunomodulatory therapy (IRR 1.95, P < 0.001). The most frequently reported local and systemic reactions included injection site pain (87% after dose 1, 86% after dose 2) and fatigue (60% after dose 1, 80% after dose 2). Reactogenicity increased after dose 2, particularly for systemic reactions. No allergic reactions or SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses were reported. CONCLUSION: Flares of underlying RMD following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were uncommon. There were no reports of severe flares. Local and systemic reactions typically did not interfere with daily activity. These early safety data can help address vaccine hesitancy in RMD patients.",

Although the currently used COVID-19 vaccine is considered safe, some concerns persist regarding the likelihood of flares of rheumatic diseases. Still's disease is a rare auto-inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, and the data on the flare of Still's disease following COVID-19 vaccination are limited. Therefore, we hereby present the case of a 34-year-old female patient with Still's disease who experienced a flare after a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. The patient visited the emergency department complaining of fever, arthralgia, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain and macular salmon-pink rash on her back for the past 2 days.

We report the first case of adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) developing in a 36-year-old, previously healthy woman after the first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer). She visited our hospital due to high spiking fever and sore throat that developed 10 days after vaccination. Based on thorough investigations and changes in symptoms and signs after admission, she was diagnosed with AOSD and treated with high dose steroids and tocilizumab. This report suggests the possibility that AOSD could be triggered by COVID-19 vaccines through activation of the innate immune system.",

      "Abstract": "The objective of this study is to identify post SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 (BioNTech & Pfizer) side effects in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at the Cayetano Heredia Hospital, Lima, Peru. A descriptive observational study was designed in patients with SLE at the Immuno-Rheumatology Department of the Cayetano Heredia Hospital, Lima, Peru, immunized with the BNT162b2 vaccine from May 21 to June 30, 2021. Of the total number of patients seen in the service, 100 received the vaccine's 1st dose, and 90 patients received the 2nd dose; 90% and 92.2% presented symptoms within 10 days after immunization (1st and 2nd doses, respectively), being pain at the inoculation site the most frequent (87%); most of the symptoms presented were of mild intensity. There were 27 episodes of post-immunization flare, 9% and 20% after the 1st and 2nd doses, respectively; the predominant type of flare was articular (85.1%), followed by dermal (18.5%). It was found that a history of renal involvement was associated with the risk of developing flare RR 0.38 (0.15-0.91) and the use of hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine prior to immunization 0.20 (0.06-0.63) and 7.96 (2.70-23.43) respectively. In 100 SLE patients immunized with BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, 27% of SLE reactivation episodes occurred, two patients were hospitalized for flare severity, and none died. Key Points • Up to 92.2% presented some type of symptom after vaccination, being mostly local and of mild intensity. • Of the population studied, there were 27 episodes of",

      "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multi-system disease that causes multiple complications. It is linked to the development of new-onset diabetes or unmasking of underlying diabetes. Despite the uncertain exact mechanism, pancreatic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, the main enzyme related to COVID-19 pathophysiology has been implied. COVID-19 vaccine was authorized to help control the rapid spread of COVID-19 disease. We report a case of new-onset diabetes type 2 presenting as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) in a patient after receiving COVID-19 vaccine with some literature review of the potential mechanisms by which COVID-19 may cause new-onset diabetes type 2.",

      "Abstract": "The vaccine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to potentially cause or worsen diabetes. A 73-year-old Japanese woman received two doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Four weeks after the second vaccination, her glycemic control began to deteriorate, and 8 weeks after the second vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with new-onset type 1 diabetes that was strongly positive for autoantibodies and showed a disease-susceptible human leukocyte antigen haplotype, DRB1*04:05:01-DQB1*04:01:01. The glucagon stimulation test suggested an insulin-dependent state, and induction of intensive insulin therapy brought about fair glycemic control. The time period from the COVID-19 vaccination to the development of type 1 diabetes was relatively longer than to the onset or exacerbation of type 2 diabetes, as previously reported, suggesting the complicated immunological mechanisms for the destruction of β-cells associated with the vaccination. In recipients with the disease-susceptible haplotypes, one should be cautious about autoimmune responses for several months after the vaccination.",

It is indicated to be used in patients ≥12 years-of-age as of May 25th, 2021, including populations with high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) burden. However, little is known about the potential impact this vaccine may have on serum lipoprotein levels in patients with familial hypercholesteremia (FH), who are predisposed to high ASCVD burden due to elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We present an interesting case where a patient with heterozygous FH (HeFH) and elevated triglycerides (TG)-controlled for years on medication and apheresis-experienced significantly elevated TG, one day after receiving his second Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine dose. It is not known whether this adverse event may be seen in other FH patients and may be worth assessing in such patients to determine the possibility of a rare adverse reaction from a COVID-19 vaccine.",

METHODS: Original reports of SAT developed after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (mRNA, viral vector, or inactivated virus vaccines) were retrieved from a search of electronic databases. Individual patient data on demographics, medical history, type of vaccine, workup and therapies were collected. Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis and chi-squared tests were employed for comparisons. RESULTS: 30 articles including 48 reports were retrieved, 3 additional cases evaluated by the Authors were described and included for analysis. Of the 51 patients, 38 (74.5%) were women, median age was 39.5 years (IQR 34-47). Patients developed SAT after a median of 10 days (IQR",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has been reported to cause subacute thyroiditis, the mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to induce thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis. CASE REPORT: : We describe 3 patients with no history of thyroid disease who presented with symptomatic, biochemical, and radiological evidence of thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis, 10 to 20 days after receiving either Pfizer Bio-NTech or Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. All patients presented with thyrotoxicosis but with negative thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins for Graves disease and no autonomous nodules. Two patients underwent thyroid uptake scans that confirmed thyroiditis. One patient had significantly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and interleukin-6. All patients showed improvement in symptoms with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 1 patient eventually required steroids for symptom control. DISCUSSION: The mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 was associated with thyroiditis and led to thyrotoxicosis. Elevated proinflammatory markers and cytokines after vaccines may play a major role. CONCLUSION: Our case series report highlights a possible relationship between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis, which has not been recognized by health providers.",

Infective processes, including that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are recognised as the major precipitant of adrenal crises. Adverse reactions to the ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine occur in a significant proportion of individuals, however, are mild-moderate in the majority of cases. DESIGN: Case series. PATIENTS & RESULTS: We describe five cases where more severe adverse reactions to the ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine led to actual or incipient adrenal crises requiring parenteral hydrocortisone within 24 h of receiving the first ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. CONCLUSION: In individuals with adrenal insufficiency, adverse reactions to the initial dose of the ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can precipitate adrenal crises. We recommend that patients with AI should immediately increase their maintenance glucocorticoid dosage 2-3 fold on experiencing any symptoms in the initial 24 h following vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "Sarcoidosis can present as an acute form or take a chronic course. One of the acute presentations is Löfgren's syndrome (LS), consisting of the symptom triad of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum, and ankle periarthritis. In addition, there are occasional reports of sarcoid-like reactions following drug exposures. Nevertheless, reports of sarcoidosis or LS after vaccination have not been published. Here, we report two cases of de novo LS in a temporal association with different vaccines against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. One patient developed the first symptoms three days after the second vaccination (first vaccination ChadOx-1, Astra Zeneca; second vaccination CX-024414, Moderna); in the second patient, symptoms started 28 days after the first vaccination (ChadOx-1, Astra Zeneca). Both patients eventually required treatment with glucocorticoids. Both patients achieved clinical improvement with treatment. In conclusion, we report the first two cases of LS shortly after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "Since February 26, 2021, when vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in South Korea, patients who visited the Korea University Guro Hospital with suspected adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination were monitored actively with interest. We encountered five unusual cases of polyarthralgia and myalgia syndrome in patients who received the ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine. The patients (median age 67 years) were not previously diagnosed with arthropathy and rheumatologic diseases. They developed fever, myalgia, joint pain, and swelling three to seven days after vaccination. The symptoms persisted for up to 47 days despite antipyretic treatment. Arthralgia occurred in multiple joints, including small and large joints. A whole-body Technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate bone scan revealed unusual uptakes in the affected joints.",

      "Abstract": "Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that may have variable presentations. The presentation may depend on the type of catecholamine secreted, whether there is a paraneoplastic syndrome or not, or some other factor which may not be well understood. One rare presentation is a pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis. Many of these tumors are asymptomatic and found incidentally, but some can be triggered after being previously dormant. In this case report, we describe the first case of pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis triggered by the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. We describe a case of a 63-year-old Caucasian male who presented with intractable nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, watery diarrhea, chills, sweats, and heavy chest pain starting one day status post J&J COVID-19 vaccination. He had no symptoms prior to this and no significant past medical history besides daily marijuana use. During his hospital stay, he had persistent high fevers, respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiomyopathy, and labile blood pressure measurements. After a retroperitoneal ultrasound, he was found to have a 7 cm mass in the right adrenal gland with elevated chromogranin A, urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and urinary 24-hour metanephrines to confirm the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma.",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but fatal complication of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine. The many reports of VITT have mostly been in the Caucasian population. Here, we present the first reported case in an Asian population. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old female had severe headache and severe thrombocytopenia 8 days after administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca. Although no thrombosis was demonstrated by imaging studies, she had very highly elevated d-dimer levels during hospitalization. Serology for antibodies against platelet factor 4 was positive on several days with very high optical density readings. We found that the antibody could induce spontaneous platelet aggregation without the presence of heparin. We decided to treat her with intravenous immunoglobulin, high-dose dexamethasone, and a prophylactic dose of apixaban. She improved rapidly and was discharged from the hospital 6 days after admission. Neither thrombocytopenia nor thrombosis was subsequently detected at the three-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lower rate of thrombosis, VITT can occur in the Asian population. Early detection and prompt treatment of VITT can improve the patient's clinical outcome. Thromboprophylaxis with nonheparin anticoagulants also prevents clot formation.",

      "Abstract": "Serious vaccine-associated side effects are very rare. Major complications of vaccines are thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in which pathogenetic mechanism is consistent with endotheliopathy characterized by \"attenuated\" sepsis-like syndrome, leading to the activation of inflammatory and microthrombotic pathway. In the COVID-19 pandemic, acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by microthrombosis has been the major clinical phenotype from the viral sepsis in association with endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD), sometimes presenting with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome. Often, venous thromboembolism has coexisted due to additional vascular injury. In contrast, clinical phenotypes of vaccine complication have included \"silent\" immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP-like syndrome), multiorgan inflammatory syndrome, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in particular. These findings are consistent with venous (v) EA-VMTD. In vEA-VMTD promoted by activated complement system following vaccination, \"consumptive\" thrombocytopenia develops as ITP-like syndrome due to activated unusually large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) path of hemostasis via microthrombogenesis. Thus, the pathologic phenotype of ITP-like syndrome is venous microthrombosis. Myocarditis/pericarditis and other rare cases of inflammatory organ syndrome are promoted by inflammatory cytokines released from activated inflammatory pathway, leading to various organ endotheliitis.",

      "Abstract": "The development of various autoimmune diseases has been reported after COVID-19 infections or vaccinations. However, no method for assessing the relationships between vaccines and the development of autoimmune diseases has been established. Aplastic anemia (AA) is an immune-mediated bone marrow failure syndrome. We report a case of severe AA that arose after the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine (the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine), which was treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this patient, antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected both before and after the HSCT. After the patient's hematopoietic stem cells were replaced through HSCT, his AA improved despite the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In this case, antibodies derived from the COVID-19 vaccine may not have been directly involved in the development of AA. This case suggests that the measurement of vaccine antibody titers before and after allogeneic HSCT may provide clues to the pathogenesis of vaccine-related autoimmune diseases. Although causality was not proven in this case, further evaluations are warranted to assess the associations between vaccines and AA.",

      "Abstract": "A 95-year-old male developed general subcutaneous petechiae, tongue hematoma, and melena two days after receiving the second BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Two days later, his platelet count decreased to below 1,000/µl. Laboratory testing was positive for a slight increase in D-dimer, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin IgG antibody levels. There were no severe infections or symptomatic thrombosis. Platelet transfusions were transiently effective. He was diagnosed with newly developed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). We administered prednisolone (PSL) at 0.5 mg/kg/day and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 0.4 g/kg/day. From the following day, his platelet count rapidly increased, with an improvement in bleeding tendency. H. pylori was eradicated after platelet count recovery. Thrombocytopenia did not relapse although PSL was tapered three months later. Causes of thrombocytopenia after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination include ITP,",

      "Abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a blood disorder in which antibodies coating platelets cause platelets destruction in the spleen with resultant low platelets count and an increased tendency for bleeding. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused by SARS-COV2; it was first identified in December/2019; though it mainly affects the respiratory system, multisystemic complications are identified. Several ITP cases post mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were reported, and different pathophysiology theories about the underlying pathophysiology were discussed, but only a few ITP relapse cases have been reported so far. We present a 28-year-old Asian male, a known patient of ITP and in partial remission for eighteen months, who presented to the emergency department with ITP relapse (platelets count of 1 × 10^3 /µL), four days after receiving the second dose of Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which required treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins and dexamethasone. We further discuss the preferred approach in ITP patients who are willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.",

After discharge, the patient presented with profuse bleeding and hematoma of the cheek. Blood tests revealed severe secondary immune thrombocytopenia (SITP). SITP was probably triggered by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 Pfizer vaccine, which was inoculated to the patient 3 days before the lesion appeared and 12 days before surgery. The authors' aim is to inform colleagues about this possible, rare, adverse effect of the vaccine. In all patients who have recently undergone the COVID-19 vaccine and who present lesions suspected to be due to blood extravasation of the oral mucosa or unjustified gingival bleeding it is advisable to request a blood count before surgery.",

Despite COVID-19 vaccine approval, pregnant women were excluded from clinical trials. We report a case of immune thrombocytopenia in the first trimester, which occurred 13 days after initiating the COVID-19 vaccination series. Thorough evaluation, including hematology consultation, established the diagnosis. High-dose oral corticosteroids were started, and she was discharged home with significant improvement in platelet count on her fourth day of hospitalization with no subsequent complications. We advocate that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risk of infection in pregnancy and that pregnant women should be included in clinical trials. Closer post-vaccination surveillance may be warranted in the pregnant population pending further data.",

Safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are urgently needed and have been rapidly approved. COVID-19 vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia was reported as a rare adverse effect in the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. A 25-year-old woman, who was previously diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP, stage I), had exacerbated severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 6,000/μL) with a headache, joint pain, general fatigue, and bleeding tendency three days after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Pulsed high-dose dexamethasone therapy rapidly ameliorated the ITP.

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an immune response that destroys platelets and increases the risk of bleeding, which can range from bruising to intracranial hemorrhage. ITP is a known complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the first studies of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine, there were no reports of ITP and the incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was low overall. Here, we present a case of ITP as a complication of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. CASE REPORT Three days after receiving a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, a 39-year-old woman presented with a petechial rash on her trunk, legs, and arms, and fatigue and muscle aches. At the time of her hospital admission, her platelet count was 1000/µL. A peripheral smear showed profound thrombocytopenia. During the course of the patient's hospitalization, she was treated with 2 units of platelets, 2 infusions of i.v. immunoglobulin, and i.v. methylprednisolone. Her platelet count increased to 92 000/µL on the day of discharge and she was prescribed a tapered dose of oral prednisone. One day later, her rash had resolved and her platelet count was 243 000/µL. The patient recovered completely with no complications. CONCLUSIONS ITP should be considered a severe AE of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Knowing the early signs and symptoms of ITP will become increasingly important as more of the population receives this vaccine. Quick diagnosis and management are essential to avoid life-threatening bleeding.",

      "Abstract": "Novel mRNA and vector-based covid-19 vaccinations have shown high efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Compared with the number of performed vaccinations, rates of severe side effects seem low. Rare prothrombotic coagulation disorders with suspected association to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) have been reported. These cases have gathered considerable media attention and caused a temporary pause of usage of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe and several other countries and are currently discussed as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). However, hemorrhagic complications from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination have also been reported but, so far, received less public attention despite considerable potential for life-threatening complications. Here we present a case of severe immune thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 covid-19 vaccination and its successful primary management.",

      "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder, characterised by the presence of autoantibodies to clotting factor VIII (FVIII). AHA can be idiopathic or occur in the context of malignancy, autoimmune disease, drugs, or pregnancy. Recently, cases of AHA following both COVID-19 infection and vaccination have been reported. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 95-year-old female who was immunised with the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, with doses given three weeks apart. Spontaneous bruising over her extremities appeared one week after the initial dose, with hospital admission occurring three weeks after the second. Examination revealed a large haematoma on the dorsum of the right hand with resultant bleeding and widespread ecchymoses. Investigations confirmed a diagnosis of AHA. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Initial management included high dose prednisolone, recombinant Factor VIII and tranexamic acid. There was no significant clinical improvement after three days, so intravenous rituximab 100 mg weekly for four weeks was commenced. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) normalised after two doses and Factor VIII level reached 0.68U/ml on day + 22. The patient was successfully discharged from hospital after 37 days. DISCUSSION: Four cases of AHA following administration of COVID mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) have been documented. AHA should be a differential in patients presenting with bleeding following COVID-19 vaccination, in the presence of a normal platelet count. Rapid recognition, prompt initiation of immunosuppressive treatment and rigorous supportive cares are required to minimise morbidity and mortality.",

Cases were identified by reports to the Victorian state vaccine safety service, SAEFVIC, of individuals aged 18 years or older presenting with thrombocytopenia following COVID-19 vaccination without evidence of thrombosis.

Fifty-two consecutive chronic ITP patients were prospectively followed after COVID-19 vaccination. Fifteen percent had no worsening of clinical symptoms but no post-vaccination platelet count; 73% had no new symptoms and no significant platelet count decline. However, 12% had a median platelet count drop of 96% within 2-5 days post vaccination with new bleeding symptoms; after rescue therapy with corticosteroids +/- intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), platelets recovered to >30 × 10(9) /l a median three days later. ITP exacerbation occurred independently of remission status, concurrent ITP treatment, or vaccine type. Safety of a second vaccine dose needs careful assessment.",

      "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic of the multisystem disease coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Since the development of COVID-19 vaccines, there has been extensive monitoring for potential serious side effects. We report an unusual presentation of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right upper extremity of a 27-year-old Caucasian female, 3 days after receipt of her second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Her relevant thrombophilia workup was negative on initial presentation. She was treated with rivaroxaban for 3 months and her symptoms of right upper extremity swelling, and pain improved. Considering our case did not have any evidence of thrombocytopenia, we discuss the possible pathophysiology of acute DVT following Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in contrast to adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S), including mRNA COVID-19 vaccine binding to pattern recognition receptors (PRR) in the endosomes and cytosol leading to a pro inflammatory cascade and coagulopathy. We highlight the importance of initial workup for acute DVT post COVID-19 vaccination, that should include complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PTT), D-dimer levels, fibrinogen levels, platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) followed by a confirmatory PF4 platelet activation assay such as serotonin release assay,",

An a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13 (ADAMTS13) activity level of <10% and ADAMTS13 inhibitor positivity confirmed the diagnosis of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Combination therapy with plasma exchange, corticosteroid, and rituximab improved the clinical outcome. We herein report the first Japanese case of TTP possibly associated with vaccination.

For cancer patients, cancer-related thromboembolism is another lethal complication. When cancer patients receive their COVID-19 vaccines, the following thromboembolic events will be more complicated. We presented a case recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, who had received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccination 12 days prior. Ischemic stroke and VITT were also diagnosed. We aggressively treated the patient with steroids, immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange. The titer of anti-platelet factor four and d-dimer level decreased, but the patient ultimately died.

      "Abstract": "We report 5 cases of prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia after exposure to the ChAdOx1 vaccine (AZD1222, Vaxzevria) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients presented 5 to 11 days after first vaccination. The spectrum of clinical manifestations included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, arterial cerebral thromboembolism, and thrombotic microangiopathy. All patients had thrombocytopenia and markedly elevated D-dimer. Autoantibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) were detected in all patients, although they had never been exposed to heparin. Immunoglobulin from patient sera bound to healthy donor platelets in an AZD1222-dependent manner, suppressed by heparin. Aggregation of healthy donor platelets by patient sera was demonstrated in the presence of buffer or AZD1222 and was also suppressed by heparin. Anticoagulation alone or in combination with eculizumab or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resolved the pathology in 3 patients. Two patients had thromboembolic events despite anticoagulation at a time when platelets were increasing after IVIG. In summary, an unexpected autoimmune prothrombotic disorder is described after vaccination with AZD1222. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4 antibodies binding to platelets in",

      "Abstract": "A 62-year-old Caucasian female patient presented with abdominal pain, vomiting and fever 1 day after administration of COVID-19 vaccine. Bloodwork revealed anaemia and thrombocytosis. Abdominal CT angiography showed a mural thrombus at the emergence of the coeliac trunk, hepatic and splenic arteries, and extensive thrombosis of the superior and inferior mesenteric veins, splenic and portal veins, and the inferior vena cava, extending to the left common iliac vein. The spleen displayed extensive areas of infarction. Aetiological investigation included assessment of congenital coagulation disorders and acquired causes with no relevant findings. Administration of COVID-19 vaccine was considered a possible cause of the extensive multifocal thrombosis. After reviewing relevant literature, it was considered that other causes of this event should be further investigated. Thrombosis associated with COVID-19 vaccine is rare and an aetiological relationship should only be considered in the appropriate context and after investigation of other, more frequent, causes.",

      "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a new syndrome occurring primarily in healthy young adults, with a female predominance, after receiving the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We describe VITT syndrome characterized by severe thrombosis and thrombocytopenia found in our patient, with fatal outcome. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old man, after 13 days from the first administration of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca), presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomitus. Laboratory tests revealed a severe thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen serum levels and marked increase of D-dimer serum levels. The patient quickly developed a multiple organ failure, till death, three days after the hospital admission. RESULTS: At histology, in the lungs, interalveolar septa appeared thickened with microthrombi in the capillaries and veins. Interalveolar septa appeared thickened and showed vascular proliferation. Thrombi were detected in the capillaries of glomerular tufts. In the hearth, thrombi were observed in veins and capillaries. In the liver, voluminous fibrin thrombi were diffusely observed in the branches of the portal vein. Microthrombi were also found in the vasa vasorum of the wall of abdominal aorta. In the brain, microthrombi were observed in the capillaries of the choroid plexuses. Diffuse hemorrhagic necrosis was observed in the intestinal wall with marked congestion of the venous vessels. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient, the majority of data necessary for a VITT final diagnosis were present: thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in pulmonary, portal, hepatic, renal and mesenteric veins, associated with a marked increase of D-dimer serum levels. The finding of cerebral thrombosis in choroid plexuses, is a new finding in VITT. These features are suggestive for a very aggressive form of VITT.",

      "Abstract": "Vaccination with an adenoviral vector vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can result in the rare development of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4). This is a life-threating condition that may be accompanied by bleeding due to thrombocytopenia with thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinus or splanchnic vein. Herein, we describe the first fatal case of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome in Korea, presenting with intracranial hemorrhage caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A 33-year-old Korean man received the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. He developed severe headache with vomiting 9 days after the vaccination. Twelve days after vaccination, he was admitted to the hospital with neurological symptoms and was diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, which was accompanied by intracranial hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia and D-dimer elevation were observed, and the result of the PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody test was reported to be strongly positive. Despite intensive treatment, including intravenous immunoglobulin injection and endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, the patient died 19 days after vaccination. Physicians need to be aware of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) in adenoviral vector-vaccinated patients. Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy might be a useful therapeutic option for the treatment of TTS with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.",

      "Abstract": "During a 2-week period, we have encountered five cases presenting with the combination of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), intracerebral hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia. A clinical hallmark was the rapid and severe progression of disease in spite of maximum treatment efforts, resulting in fatal outcome in for 4 out of 5 patients. All cases had received ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine 1-2 weeks earlier and developed a characteristic syndrome thereafter. The rapid progressive clinical course and high fatality rate of CVT in combination with thrombocytopenia in such a cluster and in otherwise healthy adults is a recent phenomenon. Cerebral autopsy findings were those of venous hemorrhagic infarctions and thrombi in dural venous sinuses, including thrombus material apparently rich in thrombocytes, leukocytes and fibrin. Vessel walls were free of inflammation. Extra-cerebral manifestations included leech-like thrombi in large veins, fibrin clots in small venules and scattered hemorrhages on skin and membranes. CVT with thrombocytopenia after adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccination is a new clinical syndrome that needs to be recognized by clinicians, is challenging to treat and seems associated with a high mortality rate.",

      "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare complication after adenoviral vector vaccination against COVID-19 reported up to 24 days after ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 (AZD1222) vaccination. This report describes a case with a significantly later onset of VITT with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 42-year-old woman presenting to the emergency department 53 days after AZD1222 vaccination with sudden onset sensory aphasia and an 18-day history of headache. Cranial computed tomography (CT) showed acute intracranial hemorrhage and CT venogram demonstrated thrombosis of the left vein of Labbé and transverse and sigmoid sinus. D-dimers were elevated and despite a normal platelet count, platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibody testing was positive, confirming the diagnosis of VITT. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and argatroban, and was discharged without any neurological deficit on day 12. CONCLUSION: Our report of VITT with symptom onset on day 35 and diagnosis of cerebral sinuous thrombosis on day 53 after AZD1222 vaccination significantly enhances the time window during which VITT may occur.",

CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of 63 years old female patient with abdominal pain, confusion and tromboctytopenia. CT scan shows sinustrombosis and trombosis of the vena renalis. The diagnosis VITT was confirmed by a positive HIT test. After initiating treatment with immunoglobulines and a non-heparinoid anticoagulans, symptoms improved and platelet count increased.

In fact, the overall safety of the vaccine is highlighted by the low frequency of ADR considering that in UK, by the early June, 40 million first doses and 29 million second doses have been injected; nonetheless, 390 thrombotic events, including 71 fatal events have been reported.

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are known to provide an immune response seen on FDG PET studies. However, the time course of this metabolic response is unknown. We here present a temporal metabolic response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in oncology patients undergoing standard of care FDG PET. METHODS: 262 oncology patients undergoing standard of care FDG PET were included in the analysis. 231 patients had at least one dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine while 31 patients had not been vaccinated. The SUVmax of the lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccination was compared to the contralateral to obtain an absolute change in SUVmax (ΔSUVmax). RESULTS: ΔSUVmax was more significant at shorter times between FDG PET imaging and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, with a median ΔSUVmax of 2.6 (0-7 days), 0.8 (8-14 days), and 0.3 (> 14 days), respectively. CONCLUSION: Consideration should be given to performing FDG PET at least 2 weeks after the",

      "Abstract": "As the world embarks on mass vaccination for COVID-19, we are beginning to encounter unintended dilemmas in imaging oncology patients; particularly with regards to FDG PET/CT. In some cases, vaccine-related lymphadenopathy and FDG uptake on PET/CT can mimic cancer and lead to confounding imaging results. These cases where findings overlap with cancer pose a significant dilemma for diagnostic purposes, follow-up, and management leading to possible treatment delays, unnecessary repeat imaging and sampling, and patient anxiety. These cases can largely be avoided by optimal coordination between vaccination and planned imaging as well as preemptive selection of vaccine administration site. This coordination hinges on patient, oncologist, and radiologists' awareness of this issue and collaboration. Through close communication and patient education, we believe this will eliminate significant challenges for our oncology patients as we strive to end this pandemic.",

Enlargement of the injection site&rsquo;s draining lymph nodes is increasingly reported, but is not yet widely recognised as being possibly associated with recent vaccination. As patients at risk of a severe course of COVID-19, indicated by their medical history such as a previous diagnosis of malignancy, receive priority vaccination, newly palpable lymph nodes raise concerns of disease progression.

      "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Nationwide mass vaccination against Covid-19 started in Israel in late 2020. Soon we identified on [(18)F]FDG PET-CT studies vaccine-associated hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (VAHL) in axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes (ASLN) ipsilateral to the vaccination site. Sometimes, differentiation between the malignant and benign nature of the hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (HLN) could not be made, and equivocal HLN (EqHL) was reported. The purpose of the study was to determine the overall incidence of VAHL after BNT162b2 vaccination and also its relevance to PET-CT interpretation in oncologic patients. METHODS: A total of 951 consecutive patients that underwent [(18)F]FDG PET-CT studies in our department were interviewed regarding the sites and dates of the vaccine doses. A total of 728 vaccinated patients (All-Vac group) were included: 346 received the first dose only (Vac-1 group) and 382 received the booster dose as well (Vac-2 group). Studies were categorized as no HLN, malignant-HLN (MHL), VAHL, or EqHL. In studies with VAHL, location, [(18)F]FDG-intensity uptake and nodes size were recorded. RESULTS: The incidences of HLN were 45.6%, 36.4%, and 53.9% in All-Vac,",

      "Abstract": "As more people receive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations, the side effects of the vaccines will become more apparent. One reported side effect that has come to light is unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to the vaccination site. In general, unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy has a broad differential including malignancy, infection, autoimmune disorder, and iatrogenic etiologies. We present a case of a previously healthy 38-year-old woman who received her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior to presenting to the emergency department complaining of 2 weeks of abdominal pain and 20-pound unintentional weight loss. Unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, ipsilateral to the vaccination site, was found on a contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Subsequent diagnostic mammograms did not demonstrate evidence of malignancy; however, axillary ultrasound again revealed nonspecific lymphadenopathy. A short-term follow-up axillary ultrasound was recommended, rather than a lymph node biopsy, given the history of recent vaccination. At clinical follow-up, the patient's abdominal pain resolved and no further weight loss was noted. This case report discusses the key components and workup recommendation of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy in the setting of",

      "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Over 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been already administered across the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union at the time of writing. Furthermore, 1.82 million booster doses have been administered in the US since 13th August, and similar booster programmes are currently planned or under consideration in the UK and the EU beginning in the autumn of 2021. Early reports showed an association between vaccine administration and the development of ipsilateral axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, which could interfere with the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of breast cancer patients. In this paper, we review the available evidence on vaccine-related lymphadenopathy, and we discuss the clinical implications of the same on breast cancer diagnosis and management. METHODS: A literature search was performed - PubMed, Ovid Medline, Scopus, CINHAL, Springer Nature, ScienceDirect, Academic Search Premier and the Directory of Open Access Journals were searched for articles reporting on regional palpable or image-detected lymphadenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination. Separately, we compiled a series of case studies from the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, United Kingdom and the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, United States of America, to illustrate the impact that regional lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination can have on the diagnosis and management of patients being seen in diagnostic and therapeutic breast clinics. RESULTS: From the literature search, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 2057 patients, 737 with lymphadenopathy). The incidence of lymphadenopathy ranged between 14.5% and 53% and persisted for >6 weeks in 29% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians managing breast cancer patients should be aware that the",

      "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Recognition of the pattern of FDG uptake in hypermetabolic axillary lymph nodes (HALs) and association with recent messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination are important to prevent patient anxiety and further needless examinations or costly biopsies in cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study in a single tertiary care institution. We investigate the occurrence and pattern of HAL on FDG PET/CT scans from 650 consecutive cancer patients with recent BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Between December 20, 2020, and February 8, 2021, 650 patients (351 female patients [54%]; mean age, 68.9 years) had recent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and an FDG PET/CT scan. HALs were found in 57 (14.5%) of 394 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9%-18.7%) 12.3 ± 5.9 (1-22) days after dose 1 and in 111 (43.3%) of 256 patients (95% CI, 35.3%-52.2%; P < 0.0001) after 7.5 ± 5.4 (1-22) days after dose 2. There was no difference between dose 1 and dose 2 concerning SUVmax (3.7 ± 1.8 [1.3-11.3] and 4.5 ± 3.9 [1.4-26.3], P = 0.13, respectively), SUVmean (2.1 ± 1.0 [0.7-6.5] and 2.7 ± 2.4 [0.8-17], P = 0.08, respectively), and reactogenicity volume (2.7 ± 2.3 [0.2-11.6] cm3 and 2.7 ± 2.4 [0.2-15.5] cm3, P = 0.98, respectively). There was no difference in number and in size of positive lymph nodes between dose 1 and dose 2: 3.2 ± 2.2 (1-10) and 3.7 ± 2.4 (1-12) (P = 0.18), and 1.4 ± 0.4 cm (0.7-2.5 cm) and 1.5 ± 0.4 cm (0.6-3.2 cm) (P = 0.75), respectively.

Ipsilateral lymphadenopathy near the vaccine injection site following COVID-19 vaccination is a rather uncommon but expected adverse reaction. While axillary lymphadenopathy is more common, cases of supraclavicular lymphadenopathy in the setting of recent vaccination against COVID-19 are also being reported. Radiologists as well as referring physicians should be aware of this self-limiting process along with its ultrasonographic features and manage patients conservatively rather than performing an unnecessary immediate biopsy.",

      "Abstract": "The UK COVID vaccination programme has progressed at an astonishing rate since the first patients received their doses in December 2020. It is well known that other vaccines including influenza and human papilloma virus (HPV) can result in reactive lymphadenopathy in the axilla and/or neck. Patients are now presenting via the two week wait neck lump clinic with supraclavicular fossa and low neck lymphadenopathy related to COVID vaccination, and to similar one stop breast clinics with axillary lymph nodes. In an audit of 80 patients seen over a period of one month, we found COVID vaccine-related low neck lymphadenopathy in four cases (5%), with an additional rectal cancer patient thought to have metastatic disease who presented with a Virchow type node. COVID vaccine-related lymphadenopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of low-neck nodes if they occurred shortly after vaccination, but it is important to exclude sinister disease using ultrasound and other investigations as necessary.",

Ipsilateral lymphadenopathy is a fairly common side effect of vaccination of any kind, with its etiology most commonly related to reactive lymphadenopathy. However, Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (KFD) or necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis is rarely observed post-vaccination, with only one other case of KFD post COVID-19 vaccination reported to date. We report two more cases of KFD post COVID-19 vaccination in the Asian population, highlighting the clinical course and salient clinical, radiological and histologic findings.

      "Abstract": "Axillary lymphadenopathy on breast imaging after recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has been reported in the literature as immunization has become more widespread. While muscle edema at the injection site has been observed on MRI secondary to an immune response, ipsilateral breast imaging observations of edema have not been reported to be seen with the COVID-19 vaccinations to date. Mammographic findings such as trabecular and skin thickening, along with increased echogenicity on ultrasound, can be seen with edema secondary to capillary leak or poor lymphatic drainage, and should be considered as a possible etiology for the observed breast edema following a recent COVID-19 vaccine. Inflammatory changes observed in the breast and axillary tail post vaccination described in this case series are transient, but clinically relevant for patients who experience swelling following injection. Similar to evaluations for suspected mastitis, a short interval imaging follow up to confirm resolution may be appropriate for patients with ipsilateral vaccination histories, and could potentially reduce the number of false positive examinations in this clinical scenario. However, inflammatory breast cancer can mimic inflammation and infection, therefore close follow up to resolution is critical as to not miss cancer.",

      "Abstract": "Breast radiologists are increasingly seeing patients with axillary adenopathy related to COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination can cause levels I-III axillary as well as cervical lymphadenopathy. Appropriate management of vaccine-related adenopathy may vary depending on clinical context. In patients with current or past history of malignancy, vaccine-related adenopathy can be indistinguishable from nodal metastasis. This article presents imaging findings of oncology patients with adenopathy seen in the axilla or neck on cross-sectional imaging (breast MRI, CT, or PET-CT) after COVID-19 vaccination. Management approach and rationale is discussed, along with consideration on strategies to minimize false positives in vaccinated cancer patients. Time interval between vaccination and adenopathy seen on breast MRI, CT, or PET-CT is also reported.",

With 4 cases presenting in a consecutive 10-day period, it became apparent that metabolically active axillary lymphadenopathy is an adverse effect of COVID-19 vaccines, currently being deployed worldwide. This may lead to patients undergoing unnecessary biopsy. We have started taking a COVID-19 vaccine status history before PET/CT. If enlarged/metabolically active axillary nodes are identified in the ipsilateral vaccinated arm, then axillary ultrasound at 4 weeks is suggested.",

The ongoing global program of vaccination has led to incidental diagnosis of axillary lymphadenopathy. We present a case of increased accumulation of (18)F-FDG in an axillary lymph node in a PET/CT scan performed in a 43-year-old female patient with metastatic melanoma. The scan was performed 4 days after the AZD1222 vaccination. The occurrence of lymphadenopathy was verified with another PET/CT scan scheduled one month later. This case report presents a possible misinterpretation of PET/CT images caused by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. To avoid distress of the patient and unnecessary oncological diagnostics to verify the findings, we recommend avoiding scheduling PET/CT shortly after vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the lives of people around the world. Fortunately, sufficient vaccines are now available. Local reactions with ipsilateral lymphadenopathy are among the most common side effects. We investigated the impact of lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination on the value of ultrasound in tumour patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with melanoma or Merkel cell carcinoma were included who underwent lymph node excision and received COVID-19 vaccination within 6 weeks before surgery. The consistency of the preoperative ultrasound findings with the histopathologic findings was investigated. RESULTS: Eight patients were included (two Merkel cell carcinoma and six melanoma patients) who underwent lymph node excision between 16th April 2021 and 19th May 2021 and had previously received COVID-19 vaccination. In three of the eight patients (one Merkel cell carcinoma and two melanoma patients), lymph node metastases were erroneously diagnosed preoperatively during tumour follow-up with physical examination, ultrasound, and or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). In these three patients, the suspected lymph node metastases were located in the left axilla after COVID-19 vaccination in the left upper arm, which resulted in selective lymph node removal in two patients and complete lymphadenectomy in one patient. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy is expected to be observed much more frequently in the near future because of increasing vaccination rates. This cause of lymphadenopathy, which may in ultrasound as well as in FDG PET/CT resemble lymph node metastases, must be considered, especially in oncologic patients undergoing tumour follow-up. In addition, COVID-19 vaccination should be given as far away as possible from an underlying primary on the contralateral side to avoid oncologic misdiagnosis followed by malpractice.",

      "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Lymphadenopathy (LAP) after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with a diagnosis of cancer has been challenging. We analyzed imaging and clinical features from early cases of axillary LAP in six COVID-19 vaccine recipients with a history of breast cancer. METHOD: Among the patients with a history of breast cancer and recent COVID-19 vaccine administration, six patients who showed isolated axillary LAP were gathered. Radiologic features were reviewed from breast ultrasound, chest computed tomography, and breast magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical and pathological information were obtained for analysis. RESULTS: The interval between ultrasound detection of LAP and last COVID-19 vaccine administration ranged from 14 to 28 days (mean 21.67 days). Round shape of the lymph node and irregular cortex were noted in 2 and 0 cases, respectively. Mean maximum cortical thickness, length to width ratio and interval aggravation in maximum cortical thickening were 4.2 mm, 1.34, and 2.81-fold with cut-off value of 3 mm, 1.5, 2.0-fold, respectively. CONCLUSION: We observed axillary LAP ipsilateral to a recent vaccine administration persisting longer than what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced. In our patients, COVID-19",

Objective was to evaluate a large sample of vaccinated patients undergoing screening mammography, to determine callback rates associated with vaccine-induced adenopathy and their outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-institution retrospective review of patients who received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine prior to presentation for screening mammography from January 15 through May 31, 2021. Patient-related vaccination information (dose, brand, arm, date) was obtained by mammography technologists and available for interpreting radiologists.

      "Abstract": "Vaccination against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has created new challenges. Lymphadenopathy with increased uptake in patients undergoing PET/CT may mislead to unnecessary further evaluation. We have analyzed routinely performed PET/CT studies after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination to familiarize ourselves with the PET/CT appearance of various PET tracers and to prevent the consequences of misinterpretation. Methods: We analyzed 1,018 PET/CT studies performed between January 1, 2021, and February 15, 2021. Information about the dates and sites of vaccination was collected. Visual and semiquantitative analysis of axillary-neck lymphadenopathy and arm uptake was correlated with immunization data. Results: Increased uptake in axillary lymphadenopathy was observed unilaterally in 66% of vaccinated patients, in 55% of patients vaccinated once, and in 69% of those vaccinated twice. The intensity of uptake decreased over time. Fifty-four of 274 patients (20%) had simultaneous increased activity in the posterior arm and ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (double sign [DS]). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 55.4%, 83.6%, 86.7%, 49.2%, respectively, for axillary lymphadenopathy and 38.6%, 100%, 100%, and 66.1%, respectively, for DS. No DS was observed later than 10 and 21 d after the first and the second vaccinations, respectively. None of the nonvaccinated patients had arm uptake or DS. Conclusion: Vaccination against",

      "Abstract": "In a bid to end the current COVID-19 crisis, many countries including UK have begun a mass immunization programme. Immunization can cause transient inflammation thereby causing increased metabolic activity at injection site and hypermetabolic lymph nodes. Various vaccinations and local injections have been known to cause diagnostic dilemma due to false-positive uptake on FDG PET-CT. In this pictorial case review, we present five cases demonstrating various patterns of uptake including an ipsilateral deltoid muscle, axillary, supraclavicular, and subpectoral lymph nodes post COVID-19 vaccination. A careful history of COVID-19 vaccination and normal size and morphology of lymph node on unenhanced low-dose CT will aid the diagnosis. All patients undergoing FDG PET-CT will require detailed documentation of the vaccination history including the time interval since vaccination. Knowledge about these patterns of uptake on PET-CT will ensure accurate interpretation by Nuclear Medicine physicians and radiologists during the current vaccination drive.",

      "Abstract": "As mass COVID-19 vaccination is underway, radiologists are encountering transient FDG uptake in normal or enlarged axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes after ipsilateral deltoid vaccination. This phenomenon may confound interpretation in patients with cancer undergoing FDG PET/CT. In this article, we present our institutional approach for management of COVID-19 vaccine-related lymphadenopathy on FDG PET/CT according to early experience. We suggest performing PET/CT at least 2 weeks after vaccination in patients with a cancer for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination but optimally 4-6 weeks after vaccination given increased immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines and potentially longer time for resolution than lymphadenopathy after other vaccines. PET/CT should not be delayed when clinically indicated to be performed sooner. Details regarding vaccination should be collected at the time of PET/CT to facilitate interpretation. Follow-up recommendations for postvaccination lymphadenopathy are provided, considering the lymph node's morphology and likely clinical relevance. Consideration should be given to administering the vaccine in the arm contralateral to a unilateral cancer to avoid confounding FDG uptake on the side of cancer. Our preliminary experience and suggested institutional approach should guide radiologists in management of patients with cancer undergoing PET/CT after COVID-19 vaccination.",

He then developed symptoms consistent with pneumonitis within three to five days of his first administration of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine injection. He reported that these symptoms significantly intensified within three to five days of receiving his second dose of the vaccine.

      "Abstract": "Dermatomyositis (DM) is one of the uncommon multi-organ idiopathic inflammatory myopathies that has been reported following the hepatitis B, Influenza, tetanus toxoid, H1N1, and BCG vaccines. However, an association with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is yet to be reported. In this case, we present the case of a 43-year-old Asian Indian female who was diagnosed with DM 10 days after receiving the second dosage of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, in the absence of any additional triggering factors. The diagnosis was established based on physical examination, serological antibodies, magnetic resonance imaging of the muscles, skin biopsy, and electromyography. She received standard treatment for DM, including oral high doses of prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate, and physiotherapy. The treatment successfully reversed skin changes and muscle weakness. This is the first reported case of classic DM complicated by interstitial lung disease following COVID-19 vaccination. More clinical and functional studies are needed to elucidate this association. Clinicians should be aware of this unexpected adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination and arrange for appropriate management.",

      "Abstract": "Pityriasis rosea (PR), PR-like eruptions (PR-LE), and herpes zoster have been frequently reported during the COVID-19 pandemic and following COVID-19 vaccination. PR is a self-limiting exanthematous disease and herpes zoster is a treatable condition; therefore, their occurrence does not require discontinuation of the vaccination schedule. PR-LE is a hypersensitivity reaction and is, therefore, less predictable in its course. In the case of a booster dose, the clinical manifestation may not recur, may be different from PR-LE, or may present with systemic symptoms; however, in the case of PR-LE, the possibility of mild and predominantly cutaneous adverse events should not discourage all eligible candidates from receiving and completing the COVID-19 vaccination program, as such adverse reactions represent a small risk considering the possible severe and fatal outcome of COVID-19. We emphasize the relevance of looking for any viral reactivation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have skin eruptions. The search for viral reactivations could be useful not only for distinguishing between PR and PR-LE but also because viral reactivations may contribute to a patient's systemic inflammation and influence the course of the disease.",

      "Abstract": "(1) Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are currently employed on a population-wide scale in most countries worldwide. Data about unusual cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADR) are scant, though. (2) Methods: We retrospectively analyzed moderate to severe vaccine-related ADR in the Department of Dermatology and Allergy of the University Hospital Bonn between May to June 2021 and analyzed related skin biopsies. (3) Results: As a specialized dermatological academic center, we encountered a total of n = 19 clinically and pathologically heterogeneous cutaneous ADR with a female predominance. Delayed cutaneous ADR occurred as late as 30 days after vaccination. The majority of ADR were mild, though a few patients required systemic treatment (antihistamines, glucocorticosteroids). (4) Conclusions: The clinico-pathological spectrum of cutaneous side effects with COVID-19 vaccines is wide; however, the benefits outweigh the risks by far. More dermatopathological studies on cutaneous ADR not limited to COVID-19 vaccines are desirable to enable a better understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.",

We suggest that the already described vaccine-induced upregulation of Th1 response may play a relevant role in LP reactivation, through an increase in inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of LP.

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that has no definite treatment or preventive medication until late 2020 when vaccines were developed. Vaccines are a very useful new tool against COVID-19 that stimulate the immune system after recognition of viruses or their parts. Complications post vaccination could happen and they depend on the types, vaccine mechanism of action as well as some other patients' factors. CASE REPORT: We are reporting a 39 years old lady who is known as allergic to a strawberry and kiwi, otherwise medically free. She presented to the outpatient unit with a ten-days history of palms of the hands and soles of the feet itchiness that is associated with occasional redness after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination. There were no skin rashes or pruritis at any other sites. The patient was treated conservatively by antihistamine and the symptoms gradually resolved within five days. CONCLUSION: Allergic reaction is one of the expected complications post any COVID-19 or",

      "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire planet, and within about a year and a half, has led to 174,502,686 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with 3,770,361 deaths. Although it is now clear that SARS-CoV-2 can affect various different organs, including the lungs, brain, skin, vessels, placenta and others, less is yet known about adverse reactions from vaccines, although more and more reports are starting to emerge. Among the adverse events, we focused particularly on skin rashes. In this short report, we describe the case of a patient vaccinated with Comirnaty, who developed a purpuric rash resistant to oral steroid therapy after 2 weeks. To date, this is one of the very few cases in which skin biopsy was performed to better characterize the histopathological picture of this rash. Finally, we conduct a literature review of the cases of rashes from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines described in the literature, with the aim of laying foundations for future, larger case studies.",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a wide clinical spectrum of skin manifestations, including urticarial, vesicular, vasculitic and chilblain-like lesions. Recently, delayed skin reactions have been reported in 1% individuals following mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The exact pathophysiology and the risk factors still remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 6821 employees and patients were vaccinated at our institutions between February and June 2021. Every patient received two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in our hospitals, and reported back in case of any side effects which were collected in our hospital managed database. RESULTS: Eleven of 6821 vaccinated patients (0.16%) developed delayed skin reactions after either the first or second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Eight of 11 patients (73%) developed a rash after the first dose, while in 3/11 (27%), the rash occurred after the second dose. More females (9/11) were affected. Four of 11 patients required antihistamines, with two needing additional topical steroids. All the cutaneous manifestations resolved within 14 days. None of the skin reactions after the first dose of the vaccine prevented the administration of the second dose. There were no long-term cutaneous sequelae in any of the affected individuals. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that skin reactions after the use of",

      "Abstract": "Recently, an increasing number of cases with delayed cutaneous reaction after immunization with mRNA-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported. This adverse reaction, which is considered a delayed-type or T cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, has been described for the Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2) vaccines. We describe a delayed large local cutaneous reaction in a patient who received the viral vector vaccine Vaxzevria (ChAdOx1-S, AstraZeneca). The time course and clinical symptoms of delayed skin reaction after mRNA vaccines have a similar pattern that we recognized in our patient after Vaxzevria vaccination. This phenomenon has not been described in the Vaxzevria clinical trials and is to our knowledge the first report of this adverse reaction to a vector-based",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cutaneous reactions after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: To describe and classify cutaneous reactions after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS: A nationwide Spanish cross-sectional study was conducted. We included patients with cutaneous reactions within 21 days of any dose of the approved vaccines at the time of the study. After a face-to-face visit with a dermatologist, information on cutaneous reactions was collected via an online professional survey and clinical photographs were sent by email. Investigators searched for consensus on clinical patterns and classification. RESULTS: From 16 February to 15 May 2021, we collected 405 reactions after vaccination with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech; 40·2%), mRNA-1273 (Moderna; 36·3%) and AZD1222 (AstraZeneca; 23·5%) vaccines. Mean patient age was 50·7 years and 80·2% were female. Cutaneous reactions were classified as injection site ('COVID arm', 32·1%), urticaria (14·6%), morbilliform (8·9%), papulovesicular (6·4%), pityriasis rosea-like (4·9%) and purpuric (4%) reactions. Varicella zoster and herpes simplex virus reactivations accounted for 13·8% of reactions. The COVID arm was almost exclusive to women (95·4%). The most reported reactions in each vaccine group were COVID arm (mRNA-1273, Moderna, 61·9%), varicella zoster virus reactivation (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech, 17·2%) and urticaria (AZD1222, AstraZeneca, 21·1%). Most reactions to the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine were described in women (90·5%). Eighty reactions (21%) were classified as severe/very severe and 81% required treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous reactions after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are heterogeneous. Most are mild-to-moderate and self-limiting, although severe/very severe reactions are reported. Knowledge of these reactions during mass vaccination may help healthcare professionals and reassure patients.",

      "Abstract": "Many patients are receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, which have been associated with a variety of adverse effects. Cutaneous adverse reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations have been progressively reported, but they have not been reviewed according to their morphological clinical patterns. The objective of this review was to summarize the existing data concerning the cutaneous adverse reactions following SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and group them according to common morphological and pathogenetic patterns. We reviewed the English language literature up to 15 August 2021, using predefined keywords to identify the relevant studies evaluating cutaneous adverse reactions associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We search for recurrent morphological patterns sharing clinical signs and symptoms and physio-pathological mechanisms. Timing to onset following the first or booster dose of the vaccine, predisposing conditions, therapeutic management, and outcome were also collected. Among the dermatological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, we distinguished: (1) new onset reactions and (2) flares of preexisting dermatoses. The most common were injection site reactions, affecting 30-70% and generally mild or moderate. Small case series or single case reports included filler reactions, exanthemas, vascular lesions, urticaria, eczematous dermatitis, autoimmune bullous reactions, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. In addition, the exacerbation of chronic immuno-mediated dermatoses (mainly psoriasis and atopic dermatitis) and reactivations of herpes infection were reported. The cutaneous reactions were generally mild, self-limiting, and resembled common cutaneous drug eruptions and/or COVID-19 skin manifestations.",

We release these information at the earliest to educate colleagues and draw attention to possible reactions between the COVID-19 vaccines and foreign bodies such as breast implants.",

      "Abstract": "Fluid collection surrounding breast implants, called seroma, is a frequent issue that has diverse etiologies. We describe a 48-year-old woman with an acute onset of bilateral breast swelling occurring 5 years after aesthetic surgery and 10 days after a second SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose. At breast ultrasound, we found an abundant bilateral peri-implant seroma. Our patient noticed symptom improvement 48 h after nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment, complete disappearance of symptoms after 10 days with seroma disappearance documented by ultrasound. We hypothesized a breast implant seroma as post-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine side effect, as different other diagnosis had been excluded.",

      "Abstract": "Capsular contracture is fundamentally an immunological/inflammatory response to the implant, treating it as a foreign body in need of exclusion from the immune system. The capsule surrounding the implant is populated by a rich variety of immunologically active cells such as macrophages, T lymphocytes, and myofibroblasts. Vaccination in general and the COVID-19 vaccine in particular result in specific and nonspecific activation of the immune system, including those immune cells in proximity to the implant. This phenomenon has been previously demonstrated in delayed inflammatory reactions to previously implanted hyaluronic acid fillers following COVID-19 vaccination. This report is what is believed to be the first case of the rapid development of severe ipsilateral capsular contracture in the immediate aftermath of the second dose of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine.",

Herein, we report the case of an 80-year-old man who presented with a persistent high fever of 7 days' duration that began shortly after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. There was also a complaint of persistent lower limb pain and walking difficulty on emergency transportation. FDG PET/CT demonstrated extensive linear hypermetabolic foci along the vessels of both legs, including the hips, and the arms, supraclavicular area, chest wall, and temporal regions, suggesting systemic vasculitis. Subsequent temporal artery biopsy revealed arteritis, which is not typical of giant cell arteritis.",

Two case reports regarding the development of vitiligo after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Herein, we present a case report of a patient who developed new-onset vitiligo two weeks after receiving her COVID-19 vaccine. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, it may be related to the inflammatory cells involved in both the pathogenesis of vitiligo and the mechanism by which the COVID-19 vaccine stimulates the immune system. This case report highlights the need for further investigation into the link between COVID-19 and the development of vitiligo.",

      "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented event, and in order to control its spread and minimize its damages, all efforts are immediately mobilized. Mass vaccination is considered a promising solution to combat this universal issue. However, given the urgent need for vaccine production, some of the side effects may not have been presented during trials and will only appear during the mass vaccination. Limited vasculitis cases have been reported so far following vaccination against COVID-19. We present a case of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) induced following the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in an otherwise healthy individual.",

      "Abstract": "Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV‑2) has become a major tool in the battle against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Numerous products have been developed and more are to come. Vaccination success varies greatly between different countries. There are a number of different vaccine types, such as mRNA, DNA vaccines, adenovirus vector vaccines, and full-length spike protein nanoparticles with a special matrix. The different types may also cause a different spectrum of adverse events. With mass vaccination, post-marketing surveillance for product safety becomes increasingly important. In this review, we discuss possible hypersensitivity and cutaneous adverse events related to SARS-CoV‑2",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: As more people become vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, reports of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions are beginning to emerge. METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective case series, biopsy specimens of potential cutaneous adverse reactions from the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine were identified and reviewed. Clinical information was obtained through the requisition form, referring clinician, or medical chart review. RESULTS: Twelve cases were included. Histopathological features from two injection-site reactions showed a mixed-cell infiltrate with eosinophils and a spongiotic dermatitis with eosinophils. Three biopsy specimens came from generalized eruptions that showed interface changes consistent with an exanthematous drug reaction. Three biopsy specimens revealed a predominantly spongiotic pattern, consistent with eczematous dermatitis. Small-vessel vascular injury was seen in two specimens, which were diagnosed as urticarial vasculitis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis, respectively. There were two cases of new-onset bullous pemphigoid supported by histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence studies. Eosinophils were seen in 10 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatopathologists should be aware of potential cutaneous adverse reactions to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Histopathological patterns include mixed-cell infiltrates, epidermal spongiosis, and interface changes. Eosinophils are a common finding but are not always present. Direct immunofluorescence studies may be helpful for immune-mediated cutaneous presentations such as vasculitis or bullous pemphigoid.",

Dermatologic adverse effects appeared during clinical trials and have also been described in the population since approval. Just as descriptions and categorization of skin manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 proved important for understanding the disease itself, characterizing the effects of vaccines may also further that goal. This paper reviews the properties of the different types of vaccines currently available and under development and describes how they interact with the immune system and the clinical signs they may cause. We focus on dermatologic adverse effects reported to date and recommendations for managing them.",

In these circumstances, even rare adverse effects of vaccines may be encountered more often, if millions of people are to be vaccinated in a short period. Vaccination has the potential for causing cutaneous adverse effects. Thus, it is paramount that dermatologists worldwide are acquainted with the possible skin reaction patterns to the coming vaccines. Herein, we conduct a review to discuss the most frequent cutaneous adverse effects of vaccines and their management, with a particular focus on the expected adverse reactions for the coming severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines, such as local reactions, as well as immediate- and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrosis, serum",

Early-onset local injection reactions were the most common cutaneous side effects observed in clinical trials; delayed injection reactions were the most common cutaneous side effect reported outside of clinical trials.

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cutaneous reactions after messenger RNA (mRNA)-based COVID-19 vaccines have been reported but are not well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the morphology and timing of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: A provider-facing registry-based study collected cases of cutaneous manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: From December 2020 to February 2021, we recorded 414 cutaneous reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna (83%) and Pfizer (17%). Delayed large local reactions were most common, followed by local injection site reactions, urticarial eruptions, and morbilliform eruptions. Forty-three percent of patients with first-dose reactions experienced second-dose recurrence. Additional less common reactions included pernio/chilblains, cosmetic filler reactions, zoster, herpes simplex flares, and pityriasis rosea-like reactions. LIMITATIONS: Registry analysis does not measure incidence. Morphologic misclassification is possible. CONCLUSIONS: We report a spectrum of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We observed some dermatologic reactions to Moderna and Pfizer vaccines that mimicked SARS-CoV-2 infection itself, such as pernio/chilblains. Most patients with first-dose reactions did not have a second-dose reaction and serious adverse events did not develop in any of the patients in the registry after the first or second dose. Our data support that cutaneous reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are generally minor and self-limited, and should not discourage vaccination.",

Although vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed and approved under emergency use authorization, various adverse events have also been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. This review was undertaken to help clinicians recognize the possible manifestations and systemic pathogenesis, especially those related to the eye, after receiving COVID-19 vaccination. A systemic search was performed on 22 August 2021 through Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library for publications on ocular manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination.

      "Abstract": "The Food and Drug Administration has licensed, approved, and expanded guidelines for dozens of vaccines since 2010. Although advancements in biotechnology have made vaccines more effective and safer, none are completely free from adverse effects. Many vaccines have been implicated in causing ocular adverse events based on the temporal association of exposure and putative complication. Determination of causality is difficult. We provide an overview of vaccine side effects and also examine the English literature and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) from 2010 through 2020 for vaccine-implicated ocular adverse events. While reactions of eyelids and conjunctiva are commonly reported, the most frequently implicated serious adverse events are optic neuritis and various patterns of intraocular inflammation. Live attenuated vaccines have the potential to cause ocular infection from vaccine-strain organisms, particularly in those immunosuppressed. While postmarketing registries for suspect vaccination adverse events, such as VAERS, are unable to determine causal associations, they are a mainstay in signaling suspected trends that require investigation. The majority of probable and possible serious ocular adverse effects are distinctly uncommon.",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination are being reported amidst the growing concerns regarding vaccine's immunogenicity and safety, especially in patients with pre-existing inflammatory conditions. METHODS: Multinational case series of patients diagnosed with an ocular inflammatory event within 14 days following COVID-19 vaccination collected from 40 centres over a 3 month period in 2021. RESULTS: Seventy patients presented with ocular inflammatory events within 14 days following COVID-19 vaccination. The mean age was 51 years (range, 19-84 years). The most common events were anterior uveitis (n = 41, 58.6%), followed by posterior uveitis (n = 9, 12.9%) and scleritis (n = 7, 10.0%). The mean time to event was 5 days and 6 days (range, 1-14 days) after the first and second dose of vaccine, respectively. Among all patients, 36 (54.1%) had a previous history of ocular inflammatory event. Most patients (n = 48, 68.6%) were managed with topical corticosteroids. Final vision was not affected in 65 (92.9%), whereas 2 (2.9%) and 3 (4.3%) had reduction in visual acuity reduced by ≤3 lines and > 3 lines, respectively. Reported complications included nummular corneal lesions (n = 1, 1.4%), cystoid macular oedema (n = 2, 2.9%) and macular scarring (n = 2, 2.9%). CONCLUSION: Ocular inflammatory events may occur after COVID-19 vaccination. The findings are based on a temporal association that does not prove causality. Even in the possibility of a causal association, most of the events were mild and had a good visual outcome.",

OBSERVATIONS: The patient complained of paracentral scotoma supported by paracentral visual field loss on multiple Humphrey visual fields that corresponded to outer retinal pathology on optical coherence tomography. The patient's symptoms resolved without treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: We conclude that the clinical testing demonstrated findings consistent with AMN. AMN may be an exceedingly rare adverse ocular effect of a novel vaccine and likely only in the setting of multiple other risk factors.

      "Abstract": "Present mass vaccination against Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is the most widely used health policy and the most promising approach to curb the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic globally. However, new side effects are emerging from the mass vaccination not described during the experimental stages. In the present study, we discuss a case of acute corneal graft rejection, which has occurred 25 years after transplantation and 13 days after the administration of the BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty, BioNTech/Pfizer), which was followed-up for a period of six months. In this period, the corneal inflammation appeared twice but was successfully managed with topical therapy and supplementation of Vitamin D. A risk of corneal graft rejection must be included in the list of potential vaccine complications, in order to inform the transplanted patient to undergo a preliminary and a follow-up ocular examination, and eventually to include corneal graft in the list of contraindications to vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this article was to report a case of full-thickness corneal transplant rejection 3 days after immunization with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. METHODS: Case Report. RESULTS: A 51-year-old man with a history of keratoconus and penetrating keratoplasty underwent repeat penetrating keratoplasty for graft failure. The patient had an uncomplicated intraoperative and postoperative course with improved vision and a healthy graft. The patient received the SARS-CoV-2 Moderna vaccine on postoperative week 3, and within 3 days, the patient began developing eye pain, photophobia, and blurred vision. The patient was found to have graft rejection with corneal edema and endothelial keratic precipitates. The rejection did not improve despite a trial of increased topical steroids and ultimately evolved into graft failure. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this case of full-thickness graft rejection after the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination is the first to be reported worldwide. The temporal relationship between vaccination and subsequent rejection is highly suggestive of causation due to the short interval (3 days) between vaccination and rejection and the lack of other inciting factors in an otherwise healthy graft. Patients with corneal transplants who plan to take the COVID-19 vaccinations should be counseled on symptoms and closely monitored, and an individualized plan should be made in discussion with the ophthalmologist.",

METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: Two men, aged 73 and 56 years, with a history of penetrating keratoplasty due to keratoconus were noted to have acute corneal graft rejection 2 weeks after receiving a first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Both patients were treated with hourly dexamethasone 0.1% and oral prednisone 60 mg per day with prompt resolution of keratoplasty rejection. CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine may be have been associated with a low-risk corneal graft rejection that responded well to topical and systemic steroids. Treating physicians should be aware of this potential complication and patients should be advised to report any visual changes after vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this report was to describe 4 cases of acute corneal transplant rejection occurring in association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccination. METHODS: Four patients with prior keratoplasty developed presumed immunologic rejection after the mRNA-1273 vaccination for coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Case 1 had received Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty 6 months ago and presented with endothelial graft rejection 3 weeks after the first vaccine dose. Case 2 had undergone penetrating keratoplasty 3 years previously and presented with acute endothelial rejection 9 days after the second vaccine dose. Case 3 had prior Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and began experiencing symptoms of endothelial graft rejection 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Case 4 presented with endothelial rejection of the penetrating keratoplasty graft 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose. RESULTS: Frequent topical corticosteroids alone were initiated in all 4 cases. In case 1, the endothelial rejection line appeared fainter with improvement in visual acuity and corneal edema 5 weeks after diagnosis. Case 2 experienced complete resolution of corneal stromal edema and rejection line 6 weeks after diagnosis. Cases 3 and 4 have both experienced initial improvement with steroid treatment as well. CONCLUSIONS: These cases suggest acute corneal endothelial rejection may occur soon after either dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Prompt initiation of aggressive topical steroid therapy may result in complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms. Further studies are needed to elucidate the causal mechanism of corneal graft rejection after COVID-19 vaccination.",

PATIENT CONCERNS: Case 1: A 71 year-old female developed vision loss in her left eye 1 day after receiving a second dose of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. This patient was diagnosed with temporal inferior BRVO and secondary macular edema (ME) in her left eye. ME resolved after 3 doses of intravitreal aflibercept (IVA). After treatment, no recurrence of ME was observed.Case 2: A 72 year-old man developed vision loss in his right eye 1 day after receiving the first dose of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. This patient was diagnosed with temporal superior BRVO in the right eye without ME. The patient was followed up and did not undergo any additional treatment. DIAGNOSES: Case1: Temporal superior BRVO and secondary ME were observed in the left eye. Her",

      "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To present the clinical features of a rare case of varicella zoster infection following one dose of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in an elderly Asian Indian male. METHODS: Retrospective observational case report. RESULTS: A 71-year-old gentleman presented to us with complaints of reduced vision associated with redness and pain in his right eye for 1 week. On examination he revealed a right eye pan uveitis picture with circumcorneal congestion, multiple fine keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells and flare, vitritis and widespread areas of acute retinal necrosis. His left eye was within normal limits. Ten days prior to the presentation he had received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine following which he had developed fever for 2 days that preceded the red eye. The patient's aqueous sample tested positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV) by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from the aqueous and also from the nasopharyngeal swab was negative. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge this is the earliest description of a case that has a viral reactivation following COVID-19 vaccination. Elderly people with pre-existing comorbidities, may be at a risk of both primary coronavirus infection and unconceivable risk of aberrant immune reactions leading to a different virus infection or reactivation need to be kept in mind. We present a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccination and varicella zoster reactivation in this patient.",

      "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Uveitis is a vision-threatening inflammation and is considered an ophthalmic emergency. It generally arises as a result of autoimmune conditions, infections, or ocular trauma, but it may also occur as an isolated disorder. Over the past decades, several cases of vaccine-associated uveitis have been described, with the hepatitis B virus vaccine being the leading cause. CLINICAL CASE: A case of anterior uveitis in a 23-year-old male, with onset 14 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine, is reported here. Initial symptoms were pain, photophobia, and red eye. Ocular examination showed pericheratic and conjunctival hyperaemia, posterior synechiae, and anterior chamber cells ± keratic precipitates in the lower quadrants. The posterior segment did not show any alteration, and optical coherence tomography ruled out the presence of cystoid macular oedema. After a 10-day treatment course of topical steroids and cycloplegic eye drops, the ocular inflammatory signs disappeared and visual acuity was completely restored. Even if causality remains presumed, a warning should be given to physicians about the possibility of eye inflammation following",

      "Abstract": "An 82-year-old man with a history of herpes simplex keratitis 40 years previously presented with recurrence, 1 day following vaccination for novel COVID-19. His condition worsened despite topical treatment with ganciclovir gel. A diagnosis of herpetic stromal keratitis was made, requiring systemic aciclovir, topical prednisolone, moxifloxacin and atropine, and oral doxycycline. He improved clinically on treatment, with some residual corneal scarring. Visual acuity improved from 6/36 corrected at presentation, to 6/24 following treatment. Clearly, public and personal health benefits from vaccination are hugely important and we would not suggest avoiding vaccination in such patients. It is, however, important for ophthalmic providers to be aware of the rare potential for reactivation of herpetic eye disease following vaccination to enable prompt diagnosis and treatment.",

      "Abstract": "Purpose: To report a case of bilateral choroiditis following COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design: Case report.Results: A 34-year old male presented with visual loss one week after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Examination showed large serous detachment of the macula in the right eye and severe choroidal thickening noted on ultrasonography in both eyes. The patient's condition improved rapidly with oral corticosteroids with significant resolution of the serous detachments within two weeks of initiating treatment and complete visual recovery subsequently.Conclusions: The onset of ocular symptoms starting within one week following vaccination suggests an inflammatory or autoimmune response to the vaccine. Ophthalmologists should consider the option of autoimmune and other inflammatory ocular problems, which may manifest as uveitis, following COVID-19 vaccination. Timely diagnosis and treatment with corticosteroids can result in good visual and structural outcome.",

      "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: With the increasing numbers of COVID-19 vaccinations available there are some reports of new onset of otologic symptoms. We present our experience in recently vaccinated patients over a 30-day time frame. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary otology ambulatory practice. PATIENTS: All patients with available diagnostic codes, COVID-19 questionnaires and clinical notes. INTERVENTIONS: Observational recordings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Within the same 30-day time period in 2019, 2020, and 2021, 1.6, 2.4, and 3.8% respectively, of all office visits were for patients with the diagnosis of new onset idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) without other underlying otologic diagnoses. In this time frame in 2021, 30 patients out of the 1,325 clinical visits had new or significantly exacerbated otologic symptoms that began shortly after COVID-19 vaccination. Specifically, 18 patients received Moderna and 12 patients received Pfizer vaccine. Their mean age was 60.9±13.8 years old; 11 were women and 19 men. The mean onset of symptoms was 10.18 ± 9 days post-vaccination. Symptoms included 25 patients (83.3%) with hearing loss, 15 (50%) with tinnitus, eight (26.7%) with dizziness, and five (16.7%) with vertigo. Eleven patients had previous otologic diagnoses, including six patients with Menière's disease, two with autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), and three having both. CONCLUSIONS: There are no definite correlations to the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccination and new or worsened otologic symptoms. Vaccinated patients with new or exacerbated otologic symptoms should be promptly referred for evaluation. Suspected cases of post-vaccination otologic symptoms should be reported to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS).",

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Within the same 30-day time period in 2019, 2020, and 2021, 1.6, 2.4, and 3.8% respectively, of all office visits were for patients with the diagnosis of new onset idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) without other underlying otologic diagnoses. In this time frame in 2021, 30 patients out of the 1,325 clinical visits had new or significantly exacerbated otologic symptoms that began shortly after COVID-19 vaccination. Specifically, 18 patients received Moderna and 12 patients received Pfizer vaccine. Their mean age was 60.9±13.8 years old; 11 were women and 19 men. The mean onset of symptoms was 10.18 ± 9 days post-vaccination. Symptoms included 25 patients (83.3%) with hearing loss, 15 (50%) with tinnitus, eight (26.7%) with dizziness, and five (16.7%) with vertigo. Eleven patients had previous otologic diagnoses, including six patients with Menière's disease, two with autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), and three having both. CONCLUSIONS: There are no definite correlations to the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccination and new or worsened otologic symptoms. Vaccinated patients with new or exacerbated otologic symptoms should be promptly referred for evaluation. Suspected cases of post-vaccination otologic symptoms should be reported to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS).",

      "Abstract": "Recently published observational data suggests an increased risk of herpes zoster infection post-vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. We describe the case of VZV meningitis post BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in a young immunocompetent patient. A 39-year-old patient with no medical history presented with a vesicular rash, headache, nausea and fever, days after receiving BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. CSF analysis revealed a pleocytosis, and VZV DNA was confirmed by PCR testing. The patient received intravenous aciclovir with resolution of symptoms within 48 h. He was discharged after 14 days of treatment. Case reports of herpes zoster reactivation post vaccination and details of subsequent successful vaccination course completion have allowed us to recommend the patient receive his second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. At the time of writing, however, the patient has declined to receive further vaccination due to fears of an adverse event. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in a young patient of herpes zoster meningitis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. The sharing of clinical experiences and reporting of suspected side effects, particularly for vaccines that employ novel technology, increases knowledge of the safety profile of these vaccines and allows clinicians to better aid patients make informed decisions with regard to commencing and completing vaccination.",

      "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: As global vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 disease commence, vaccine safety needs to be closely assessed. The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness of reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD. METHODS: The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n = 491) and controls (n = 99), conducted in two rheumatology departments in Israel. RESULTS: The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n = 6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49 ± 11 years with stable AIIRD: RA (n = 4), Sjogren's syndrome (n = 1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n = 1), developed the first in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the first vaccine dose in five cases and after the second vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in an RA patient treated with tofacitinib. There were no cases of disseminated HZ disease or postherpetic neuralgia. All but one patient received antiviral treatment with a resolution of",

      "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented setback for global economy and health. Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions to substantially reduce severe disease and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination programmes are being rolled out globally, but most of these vaccines have been approved without extensive studies on their side-effects and efficacy. Recently, new-onset autoimmune phenomena after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported increasingly (e.g. immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, autoimmune liver diseases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, IgA nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus). Molecular mimicry, the production of particular autoantibodies and the role of certain vaccine adjuvants seem to be substantial contributors to autoimmune phenomena. However, whether the association between",

      "Abstract": "A 36-year-old woman presented to hospital 9 days after receiving her first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine with fever, myalgia and a sore throat. She was previously fit and well with no prior vaccine reactions.There was no clinical response to initial treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Microbiology tests including for COVID-19 were negative. At day 5, she developed pleuritic pain and a pericardial rub. Echocardiography and subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of constrictive pericarditis. Computed tomography revealed gross hepatomegaly and moderate splenomegaly. Blood tests showed raised inflammatory markers, deranged clotting, low platelets and a marked hyperferritinaemia.A presumptive diagnosis of a multi-system inflammatory disorder secondary to recent COVID-19 vaccination was made and high-dose IV methylprednisolone initiated. Following a high 'H score' of 70%-80% a diagnosis of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was made. She was treated with IV immunoglobulin with subsequent clinical response.HLH is a rare syndrome of acute and rapidly progressive systemic inflammation characterised by cytopenias, excessive cytokine production and hyperferritinaemia. The adult form has multiple triggers, including recent vaccination. This case prompts awareness among clinicians of HLH as a rare complication of COVID-19 vaccination but should not discourage individuals from vaccination.",

A 44-year-old woman presented to a UK hospital with left upper arm pain at the vaccine site a couple of days after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, which progressed to fever, diarrhoea and abdominal pain over the next few days. She had an erythematous rash on the chest with subcutaneous oedema. Her C reactive protein was 539 mg/L, white cell count of 17×10(9)/L (1.8-7.5), troponin-T of 1013 ng/L and creatine kinase of 572 u/L. She developed an unprovoked pulmonary embolism with acute kidney injury. After administration of intravenous methylprednisolone, the muscle oedema, skin rashes and acute kidney injury resolved.

      "Abstract": "A 12-year-old male was presented to the hospital with acute encephalopathy, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and elevated troponin after recent COVID-19 vaccination. Two days prior to admission and before symptom onset, he received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Symptoms developed within 24 h with worsening neurologic symptoms, necessitating admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. Brain magnetic resonance imaging within 16 h of admission revealed a cytotoxic splenial lesion of the corpus callosum (CLOCC). Nineteen days prior to admission, he developed erythema migrans, and completed an amoxicillin treatment course for clinical Lyme disease. However, Lyme antibody titers were negative on admission and nine days later, making active Lyme disease an unlikely explanation for his presentation to hospital. An extensive workup for other etiologies on cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples was negative, including infectious and autoimmune causes and known immune deficiencies. Three weeks after hospital discharge, all of his symptoms had dissipated, and he had a normal neurologic exam. Our report highlights a potential role of mRNA vaccine-induced immunity leading to MIS-C-like symptoms with cardiac involvement and a CLOCC in a recently vaccinated child and the complexity of establishing a causal association with vaccination. The child recovered without receipt of immune modulatory treatment.",

      "Abstract": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has to date granted approval or emergency use authorization to three vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and coronavirus disease 2019. In clinical trials and real-use observational studies, the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 messenger RNA coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine, as well as the Moderna mRNA-1273 messenger RNA coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine, have demonstrated high efficacy and few adverse events. CASE SUMMARY: A 20-year-old male college student in good health developed tinnitus and hematuria shortly after vaccination and progressed swiftly to a syndrome of: systemic inflammation; acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis; acute, bilateral, complete sensorineural hearing loss; radiographic evidence of acute multifocal ischemic strokes; pericardial effusion complicated by tamponade physiology requiring pericardial evacuation; pleural effusions requiring evacuation; and systemic capillary leak. An extensive clinical and research investigation, including cytokine analysis, whole blood cytometry by time of flight, and whole exome sequencing, did not reveal a definitive explanatory mechanism. CONCLUSION: While the overall safety profile of the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine remains excellent for the general population, rare serious events have been reported. In this report, we describe a case of multisystem inflammation and organ dysfunction of unknown mechanism beginning shortly after administration of the first dose of BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in a previously healthy recipient.",

Here, we present an adolescent with sickle cell disease who was fully vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and had no prior history of known or suspected infection, who presented in shock and was ultimately diagnosed with MIS-C.

      "Abstract": "Thorough postmortem investigations of fatalities following vaccination with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are of great social significance. From 11.03.2021 to 09.06.2021, postmortem investigations of 18 deceased persons who recently received a vaccination against COVID-19 were performed. Vaxzevria was vaccinated in nine, Comirnaty in five, Spikevax in three, and Janssen in one person. In all cases, full autopsies, histopathological examinations, and virological analyses for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were carried out. Depending on the case, additional laboratory tests (anaphylaxis diagnostics, VITT [vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia] diagnostics, glucose metabolism diagnostics) and neuropathological examinations were conducted. In 13 deceased, the cause of death was attributed to preexisting diseases while postmortem investigations did not indicate a causal relationship to the vaccination. In one case after vaccination with Comirnaty, myocarditis was found to be the cause of death. A causal relationship to vaccination was considered possible, but could not be proven beyond doubt. VITT was found in three deceased persons following vaccination with Vaxzevria and one deceased following vaccination with Janssen. Of those four cases with VITT, only one was diagnosed before death. The synopsis of the anamnestic data, the autopsy results, laboratory diagnostic examinations, and histopathological and neuropathological examinations revealed that VITT was the very likely cause of death in only two of the four cases. In the other two cases, no neuropathological correlate of VITT explaining death was found, while possible causes of death emerged that were not necessarily attributable to VITT. The results of our study demonstrate the necessity of postmortem investigations on all fatalities following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines. In order to identify a possible causal relationship between vaccination and death, in most cases an autopsy and histopathological examinations have to be combined with additional investigations, such as laboratory tests and neuropathological examinations.",

We experienced a case characterized by low blood pressure, persistent fever, edema due to increased systemic vascular permeability, and systemic inflammation confirmed by image and laboratory examinations after ChAdOx1 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The diagnostic criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in adults are known as fever of 3 days or more in adults, 2 or more mucocutaneous/gastrointestinal/neurologic symptoms, elevation of inflammatory markers, and clinical/imaging diagnosis of heart failure. A 67-year-old man who was medicated for hypertension and diabetes was admitted complaining of fever, maculopapular rash, diarrhea, headache, chills, and dizziness 6 days after the first vaccination of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in Korea. The COVID-19 test was negative but with low blood pressure, leukocytosis, skin rash, pulmonary edema, and increased inflammation markers. His lab findings and clinical course were consistent with those of MIS after COVID-19 vaccination. He was medicated with methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg and diuretics and recovered rapidly. He was discharged after 2 weeks and confirmed cure at outpatient clinic. We report an MIS case after COVID-19 vaccination in Korea.",

      "Abstract": "Large-scale COVID-19 vaccinations are currently underway in many countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report, besides generation of neutralizing antibodies, consistent alterations in hemoglobin A1c, serum sodium and potassium levels, coagulation profiles, and renal functions in healthy volunteers after vaccination with an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Similar changes had also been reported in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that vaccination mimicked an infection. Single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and 28 days after the first inoculation also revealed consistent alterations in gene expression of many different immune cell types. Reduction of CD8(+) T cells and increase in classic monocyte contents were exemplary. Moreover, scRNA-seq revealed increased NF-κB signaling and reduced type I interferon responses, which were confirmed by biological assays and also had been reported to occur after SARS-CoV-2 infection with aggravating symptoms. Altogether, our study recommends additional caution when vaccinating people with pre-existing clinical conditions, including diabetes, electrolyte imbalances, renal dysfunction, and coagulation disorders.",

      "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: BNT-162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines data regarding adverse events (AEs) are scarce. In this report, we aimed to describe fatal and non-fatal possible AEs after COVID-19 vaccine administration. METHODS: An observational multicenter study investigating the causes of emergency department visits and hospital admissions within 10 days of COVID-19 vaccination. Patients who received first or second doses of COVID-19 vaccines and presented to the emergency department (ED), as well as those admitted to the hospitals or intensive care units (ICUs) were included. Causes of ED, hospital, and ICU admissions and discharges were collected based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding system. RESULTS: Between December 2020 and March 2021, 1842 patients visited the ED within 10 days of COVID-19 vaccine administration. The mean age was 70.3 years. Overall, 1221 patients presented after the first dose of the vaccine and 653 after the second dose. Trauma (14.9%), hypertensive emergency/urgency (7.8%), generalized pain and arthralgia (5.7%), and chest pain (4.4%) were the most common causes of presentation to the ED. Of all ED presentations, mortality rate was at 2.2% (41 patients) with a median follow-up time of 68.0 days, versus 2.6% in unvaccinated ED patients. Postvaccination acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (46.3%), septic shock (24.4%), and cardiogenic shock (12.2%) were the most common causes of death. CONCLUSION: Although reported AEs are not necessarily caused by the vaccination, this study provides further information about possible AEs after COVID-19 immunization, especially those requiring hospital admission. This study also supports prior data that serious AEs post vaccination are much lower than primary",

      "Abstract": "Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is FDA approved for the immune-mediated peripheral nerve disorders Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy. Immunoglobulin therapy has been used increasingly with significant efficacy in the treatment of patients with disabling autoimmune forms of dysautonomia, which are most often small fiber (autonomic and/or sensory) polyneuropathies. It is recognized by most who treat these disorders, however, that patients with autonomic dysfunction treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy develop aseptic meningitis or severe lingering headache more frequently than other patient populations when this therapy is dosed in the traditional fashion. We discuss our combined 27 years of experience with the use of immunoglobulin and other immune modulatory therapy in patients with autoimmune small fiber polyneuropathy.",

      "Abstract": "COVID-19 derives from infection with Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2] and is associated with high morbidity and mortality due to release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thrombogenic agents resulting in destruction of the lungs. Many reports indicate that a considerable number of patients who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. However, increasing evidence suggests that many such patients who either recovered from or had mild symptoms after COVID-19 exhibit diffuse, multiorgan, symptoms months after the infection. These symptoms include malaise, myalgias, chest tightness, brain fog and other neuropsychiatric symptoms that were originally reported in children and named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). Now the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) announced the recognition of a similar condition in adults, named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-A). The symptoms characterizing these conditions are very similar to those associated with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS, US ICD-110 code D89.42-idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome). Hence, the possibility of MCAS should be evaluated in any patient with MIS and/or multisystem inflammatory symptoms. In either case, these syndromes should be addressed with liposomal formulation (in olive pomace oil) of the flavone luteolin (e.g. PureLut® or FibroProtek®) together with the antihistamine rupatadine, which also has anti-platelet activating factor (PAF) activity and inhibits mast cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cytokine storms in COVID-19.",

      "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: One-fifth of Covid-19 patients suffer a severe course of Covid-19 infection; however, the specific causes remain unclear. Mast cells (MCs) are activated by SARS-CoV-2. Although only recently recognized, MC activation syndrome (MCAS), usually due to acquired MC clonality, is a chronic multisystem disorder with inflammatory and allergic themes, and an estimated prevalence of 17%. This paper describes a novel conjecture explaining how MCAS might cause a propensity for severe acute Covid-19 infection and chronic post-Covid-19 illnesses. METHODS: Observations of Covid-19 illness in patients with/without MCAS were compared with extensive clinical experience with MCAS. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCAS is similar to that of severe cases within the",
