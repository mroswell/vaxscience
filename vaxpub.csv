Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions to substantially reduce severe disease and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination programmes are being rolled out globally, but most of these vaccines have been approved without extensive studies on their side-effects and efficacy. Recently, new-onset autoimmune phenomena after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported increasingly (e.g. immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, autoimmune liver diseases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, IgA nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus). Molecular mimicry, the production of particular autoantibodies and the role of certain vaccine adjuvants seem to be substantial contributors to autoimmune phenomena.

This narrative review was conducted to collect and discuss published data about neurological side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in order to discover type, frequency, treatment, and outcome of these side effects. The most frequent neurological side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are headache, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), venous sinus thrombosis (VST), and transverse myelitis. Other neurological side effects occur in a much lower frequency. Neurological side effects occur with any of the approved vaccines but VST particularly occurs after vaccination with vector-based vaccines. Treatment of these side effects is not at variance from similar conditions due to other causes. The worst outcome of these side effects is associated with VST, why it should not be missed and treated appropriately in due time. In conclusion, safety concerns against SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are backed by an increasing number of studies reporting neurological side effects. The most frequent of them are headache, GBS, VST, and transverse myelitis.

Adverse events must be carefully assessed to define whether they are causally associated with vaccination or coincidence. Neurologic adverse events following immunizations are overall rare but with significant morbidity and mortality when they occur.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old male presented with progressive sensorimotor dysfunction of the bilateral lower limbs 7 days after receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine against COVID-19. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed intramedullary lesions with gadolinium enhancement on the Th1/2 and Th5/6 vertebral levels. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing showed a mildly increased level of total protein and positive oligoclonal bands (OCB). DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with acute transverse myelitis. INTERVENTION: The patient received 5 days of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse (1000 mg/day) followed by oral prednisolone (30 mg/day with gradual tapering). OUTCOMES: The patient fully recovered from muscle weakness of the lower limbs. He was discharged from our hospital and able to independently walk without unsteadiness. LESSON: This is a rare case of transverse myelitis following COVID-19 vaccination.

CASE-FINDING METHODS: We report a patient from Panama with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by ATM and present a comprehensive clinical review of 43 patients with COVID-19-associated ATM from 21 countries published from March 2020 to January 2021. In addition, 3 cases of ATM were reported as serious adverse events during the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). RESULTS: All patients had typical features of ATM with acute onset of paralysis, sensory level and sphincter deficits due to spinal cord lesions demonstrated by imaging. There were 23 males (53%) and 20 females (47%) ranging from ages 21- to 73- years-old (mean age, 49 years), with two peaks at 29 and 58 years, excluding 3 pediatric cases. The main clinical manifestations were quadriplegia (58%) and paraplegia (42%). MRI reports were available in 40 patients; localized ATM lesions affected ≤3 cord segments (12 cases, 30%) at cervical (5 cases) and thoracic cord levels (7 cases); 28 cases (70%) had longitudinally-extensive ATM (LEATM) involving ≥4 spinal cord segments (cervicothoracic in 18 cases and thoracolumbar-sacral in 10 patients). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurred in 8 patients, mainly women (67%) ranging from 27- to 64-years-old. Three ATM patients also had blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO) and two more also had acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). CONCLUSIONS: We found ATM to be an unexpectedly frequent neurological complication of COVID-19. Most cases (68%) had a latency of 10 days to 6 weeks that may indicate post-infectious neurological complications mediated by the host's response to the virus. In 32% a brief latency (15 hours to 5 days) suggested a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2.

Vaccination is the most efficient tool to end this pandemic, but vaccine surveillance is necessary to identify side effects. Some studies have shown that neurological complications after COVID-19 vaccination are rare and dominated by demyelinating disease.

The diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was confirmed according to the clinical features, the albumino-cytological dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the electroneuromyography findings. The workup for all known infections associated with immune-mediated GBS was negative. The patient received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin.

Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid-March to mid-April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within 2 weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All seven patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4- to 10-fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in <20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

One of the vaccines approved against COVID-19 is the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech). CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 71-year-old man with no history of the SARS-CoV-2 infection or any recent viral or bacterial illnesses who presented with bilateral oculomotor palsy and limb ataxia after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. The diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) was established based on physical examination, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF), and positron emission tomography (PET). There was no evidence of other predisposing infectious or autoimmune factors, and the period from COVID-19 vaccination to the appearance of neurological symptoms was similar to that of other vaccines and preceding events, such as infection. CONCLUSION: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variants after COVID-19 vaccination are extremely rare. Note that more research is needed to establish an association between MFS and COVID-19 vaccines. In our opinion, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination largely outweigh its risks.",Vaccine Publication

The messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are novel strategies requiring clinical surveillance for adverse events. CASE REPORT: We report a 43-year-old previously healthy female with an optic neuritis attack 24 hours following immunization with the second dose of coronavirus disease of 2019 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. A second transverse myelitis attack together with an elevated anti-AQP-4 antibody titer confirmed the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. CONCLUSION: Our case identifies the BNT162b2 vaccine as a possible trigger for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. This rare and potentially coincidental event has no implications for vaccine administration practices. However, further research is needed to elucidate the effects of mRNA vaccines on humoral and cell-mediated immunity.",Vaccine Publication

Anecdotal reports suggest that the vaccines may be associated with brain, spinal cord, peripheral nervous system, and cardiac inflammation. Based on the high morbidity and unpredictable course of COVID-19, and the need to achieve herd immunity, vaccination has been recommended for patients with MS. We report clinical and MRI features of seven individuals who received the Moderna (n = 3) or Pfizer (n = 4) SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Within one to 21 days of either the first (n = 2) or second (n = 5) vaccine dose, these patients developed neurologic symptoms and MRI findings consistent with active CNS demyelination of the optic nerve, brain, and/or spinal cord. Symptoms included visual loss, dysmetria, gait instability, paresthesias, sphincter disturbance, and limb weakness. Age ranged from 24 to 64 (mean 39.1) years; five were woman (71.4%). The final diagnosis was exacerbation of known stable MS (n = 4, two were receiving disease-modifying therapy at the time of vaccination), new onset MS (n = 2), or new onset neuromyelitis optica (n = 1).

OBJECTIVES: Development of a diagnostic and therapeutic standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of clinical and basic research findings, expert opinions, and experience with our own cases. RESULTS: VI-CVST usually manifests on day 4-24 after vaccination, mostly in individuals aged < 60 years, and women. In the majority there is an immune pathogenesis caused by antibodies against platelet factor 4/polyanion complexes, leading to thrombotic thrombocytopenia which can result in severe, sometimes fatal, course. The cardinal symptom is headache worsening within days which, however, also can be of variable intensity. Other possible symptoms are seizures, visual disturbance, focal neurological deficits and signs of increased intracranial pressure. If VI-CVST is suspected, the determination of plasma D‑dimer level, platelet count, and screening for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT-2) are essential for treatment decision-making. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with venous MR-angiography is the neuroimaging modality of choice to confirm or exclude VI-CVST. On T2* susceptibility-weighted MRI, the clot in the sinuses or veins produces marked susceptibility artifacts (""blooming""), which also enables the detection of isolated cortical venous thromboses.

A mechanism similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was proposed with antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4). Vaccine related arterial thrombosis in the brain is rare but life-threatening and optimal treatment is not established. We report clinical, laboratory, imaging findings and treatment in a 51-year-old female presenting with acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion 7 days after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Due to low platelet count and suspicion of VITT she was not eligible for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and proceeded to mechanical thrombectomy (MER) with successful recanalization four hours after onset of symptoms. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux was initiated. Presence of anti-PF4 antibodies was confirmed. The patient improved clinically with normalization of platelet count. Clinicians should be alert of VITT in patients with acute ischemic stroke after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination and low platelet counts. MER showed to be feasible and effective. We propose considering MER in patients with VITT and large vessel occlusion despite thrombocytopenia. High-dose IVIG should be started immediately. Alternative anticoagulation to heparin should be started 24 hours after stroke onset unless significant hemorrhagic transformation occurred. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated and should be considered only in severe hemorrhagic complications. Restenosis or reocclusion of the revascularized artery is possible due to the hypercoagulable state in VITT and angiographic surveillance after the procedure is reasonable.",Vaccine Publication

Blood tests revealed mildly elevated D-dimer, pre-diabetes and hyperuricemia. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intracerebral bleeding (ICB) in the left temporal lobe. Aphasia resolved almost completely within a few days. Blood pressure values were normal throughout hospitalisation. Whether there was a causal relation between the ICB and the vaccination remains speculative but cannot be definitively excluded. CONCLUSIONS: A second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be followed by ICB. Though the pathophysiology of ICB remains unexplained a causal relation between ICB and the vaccination cannot be excluded. Risk factors for ICB should be carefully monitored in patients undergoing",Vaccine Publication

During the last months, different types of vaccines have been designed to contain the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with successful results in many countries. Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNtech) COVID-19 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside mRNA vaccine encoding the prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Although vaccines have an undeniable efficacy, they can also present several neurological side effects, including headache. According to ICHD-3 Classification, status migrainosus (SMg) is described as a debilitating migraine attack lasting for more than 72 h. Symptoms of SMg can be very severe, preventing the normal daily activities of the individual. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present report, we describe a case of SMg that lasted 11 days, time correlated with the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer/Comirnaty) in a 37-year-old woman with a history of migraine without aura. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a history of migraine, COVID-19 vaccination could lead to a worsening of headache and, in rare cases, to the development of a SMg. This may be related to the inflammatory response that occurs after vaccination.",Vaccine Publication

Newly developed mRNA vaccines can prevent the spread of the virus. Headache is the most common neurological symptom in over 50% of those vaccinated. Detailed information about the clinical characteristics of this form of headache has not yet been described. The aim of the study is to examine in detail the clinical characteristics of headaches occurring after vaccination against COVID-19 with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for the first time. In a multicentre observational cohort study, data on the clinical features and corresponding variables were recorded using a standardized online questionnaire. The questionnaire was circulated to 12 000 residential care homes of the elderly as well as tertiary university hospitals in Germany and the United Arab Emirates. The primary outcomes of this study are the clinical features of headache after vaccination. Comorbidities, treatment with medication and sociodemographic variables are also analysed. A total of 2349 participants reported headaches after vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Headaches occur an average of 18.0 ± 27.0 h after vaccination and last an average duration of 14.2 ± 21.3 h. Only 9.7% of those affected also report headaches resulting from previous vaccinations. In 66.6% of the participants, headache occurs as a single episode. A bilateral location is indicated by 73.1% of the participants. This is most often found on the forehead (38.0%) and temples (32.1%). A pressing pain character is indicated by 49.2% and 40.7% report a dull pain character. The pain intensity is most often moderate (46.2%), severe (32.1%) or very severe (8.2%). The most common accompanying symptoms are fatigue (38.8%), exhaustion (25.7%) and muscle pain (23.4%). Headaches after COVID-19 vaccination show an extensive complex of symptoms.

The aim of the current study is to raise awareness for potential adverse reactions. METHODS: This is a case series of patients diagnosed with perimyocarditis following vaccination. Patients were compiled from 3 pediatric medical centers in Israel through a network of pediatricians and data regarding those cases was collected. In addition, incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was compared with previous years. RESULTS: All patients were males 16-18 years old, of Jewish descent, who presented with chest pain that began 1-3 days following vaccination (mean, 2.1 days). In 6 of the 7 patients, symptoms began following the 2nd dose and in 1 patient following the 1st dose. All cases were mild and none required cardiovascular or respiratory support. The incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was elevated in comparison to previous years.

As vaccine administration continues to increase, potential adverse outcomes, to include myocarditis, are being reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. CASE REPORT: This case report describes a 17-year-old male patient who developed focal myocarditis mimicking an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) 3 days after administration of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Myocarditis is a rare complication in adolescents receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Focal myocarditis may demonstrate localizing electrocardiographic changes consistent with a STEMI. Overall, complications of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are extremely rare.

He had received the BNT162b2 vaccine two days prior to his presentation to the ED. The patient had an elevated troponin at 89 ng/L which increased on repeat examination. His electrocardiogram showed diffuse concave ST segment elevations and a later MRI confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis. The patient had a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 approximately two months prior to the onset of his symptoms, but since he had fully recovered before the time of his presentation to the ED, it is unlikely that the infection caused the myocarditis.

Given the emergency use authorizations for these vaccines, their side effects and safety were assessed over a compressed time period. Hence, ongoing monitoring for vaccine-related adverse events is imperative for a full understanding and delineation of their safety profile. CASE PRESENTATION: An 22-year-old Caucasian male presented to our hospital center complaining of pleuritic chest pain. Six months prior he had a mild case of COVID-19, but was otherwise healthy. He had received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine three days prior to developing symptoms. Laboratory analysis revealed a markedly elevated troponin and multiple imaging modalities during his hospitalization found evidence of wall motion abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of perimyocarditis. He was started on aspirin and colchicine with marked improvement of his symptoms prior to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of perimyocarditis that was temporally related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in an young male with prior COVID-19 infection but otherwise healthy. Our case report highlights an albeit rare but important adverse event for clinicians to be aware of. It also suggests a possible mechanism for the development of myocardial injury in our patient.",Vaccine Publication

Growing numbers of myopericarditis cases after COVID-19 vaccination are being reported, mostly in younger adults. While most of these patients have recovered rapidly and without complications, it is still unclear whether patients who are older and have greater cardiac dysfunction secondary to myopericarditis will also experience the same recovery. CASE REPORT We report the case of a middle-aged man with myopericarditis and significant left ventricular dysfunction after the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. He presented several days after vaccination, and with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment, he quickly recovered ventricular function, and symptoms resolved within 1 week after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Vaccines are a key tool in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, yet many people are hesitant to seek vaccination, perhaps for fear of adverse events. Our report of a middle-aged patient with significant left ventricular dysfunction, who still experienced rapid recovery, should reassure the public about the safety of vaccines. Such rare adverse effects should not deter people from receiving COVID-19 vaccination.",Vaccine Publication

Echocardiography showed minimal pericardial effusion but normal myocardial contractility. Electrocardiography revealed diffuse ST elevation in lead II, and V2-5. Cardiac magnetic resonance images showed the high signal intensity of T2- short tau inversion recovery image, the high value of T2 mapping sequence, and late gadolinium enhancement in basal inferior and inferolateral wall.

Recently published case series have reported a possible association between acute myocarditis and COVID-19 vaccination, predominantly in young males. METHODS: We report a case series of 5 young male patients with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-confirmed acute myocarditis within 72 h after receiving a dose of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Our case series suggests that myocarditis in this setting is characterized by myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement in the lateral wall of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium, reduced global LV longitudinal strain, and preserved LV ejection fraction. All patients in our series remained clinically stable during a relatively short inpatient hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with other recently published case series and national vaccine safety surveillance data, this case series suggests a possible association between acute myocarditis and COVID-19 vaccination in young males and highlights a potential pattern in accompanying CMR abnormalities.",Vaccine Publication

Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a long QT interval (QTc = 600 milliseconds). Laboratory tests revealed elevated troponin and lack of evidence of viral infection. Further investigations revealed the vaccine-induced myocarditis and arrhythmias linked to it.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of hepatic artery occlusion after the first dose vaccination by ChAdOx1nCov-19. The patient was a health care worker, aged 34-year old. Past medical history was unremarkable and had not used heparin. Over the next couple of days after the vaccination, he reported headache, nausea, and dizziness as well as abdominal pain. His general status and the laboratories studies deteriorate quickly by increasing liver enzymes and severe coagulopathy. Clinically he had presented acute hepatic failure. He had been received blood products, prednisolone pulse along with broad antibiotics without benefit. He died on the sixth day. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombotic events after vaccination is very rare but can develop in main arteries with lethal outcome. This event may mimic autoimmune thrombosis clinically.",Vaccine Publication

Most of these vaccines have received approval without being extensively whetted for their adverse effect and efficacy profiles. Most adverse effects have been mild, nonetheless, more serious thromboembolic events have also been reported. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) can occur in predisposed individuals where an immune mediated reaction against hepatocytes is triggered by environmental factors. Vaccines are a very rare cause of AIH. We report two such cases of AIH triggered by COVID (Covishield) vaccination. While one patient made an uneventful recovery, another succumbed to the liver disease. Ours is the first report of Covishield vaccination related AIH and second ever after any form of COVID vaccination. We hope that our report does not deter COVID vaccination drives. However, we also hope to raise awareness of its potential side effects and the increased role of pharmacovigilance in guiding treatment.",Vaccine Publication

A 50-year-old previously healthy man was admitted to our hospital following the appearance of peripheral edema. Ten days earlier, he had received the first injection of the vaccine. Four days after injection, he developed lower leg edema, which rapidly progressed to anasarca. On admission, serum creatinine was 2.31 mg/dL and 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 6.9 grams. As kidney function continued to decline over the next days, empirical treatment was initiated with prednisone 80 mg/d. A kidney biopsy was performed and the findings were consistent with MCD. Ten days later, kidney function began to improve, gradually returning to normal. The clinical triad of MCD, nephrotic syndrome, and AKI has been previously described under a variety of circumstances, but not following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The association between the vaccination and MCD is at this time temporal and by exclusion, and by no means firmly established.

Nevertheless, the impact of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine on triggering de novo/relapsing glomerulonephritis (GN) is limited. We report a case series of patients who developed new or relapsing GN postvaccination. METHODS: We evaluated baseline characteristics, vaccine type, and clinical outcomes of 13 patients from our institution who had a new diagnosis or relapse of their GN post-mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Of 13 patients, 8 patients were newly diagnosed with having GN and 5 patients had relapse. Median age was 62 years (range 19-83 years). Autoimmune disease (38%) was the most prevalent underlying disease followed by cancer (23%). Most patients were White males. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was the most common GN in our series (5 patients, 38%) followed by membranous nephropathy (MN) (3 patients, 23%). There was 1 patient with IgAN who had evidence of IgA deposits before vaccination suggesting the immune activation after vaccination triggered a flare of the disease. Our case series also included the first case report of tip-variant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), NELL-1-associated MN, and atypical anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis. A total of 77% developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with most being Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 1 (67%). Outcomes are favorable with 80% responding to therapy. CONCLUSION: New cases and relapse of GN can present shortly after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. New cases of IgAN may result from unmasking of undiagnosed IgAN owing to robust immune activation rather than development of new deposits.",Vaccine Publication

Nevertheless, the impact of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine on triggering de novo/relapsing glomerulonephritis (GN) is limited. We report a case series of patients who developed new or relapsing GN postvaccination. METHODS: We evaluated baseline characteristics, vaccine type, and clinical outcomes of 13 patients from our institution who had a new diagnosis or relapse of their GN post-mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Of 13 patients, 8 patients were newly diagnosed with having GN and 5 patients had relapse. Median age was 62 years (range 19-83 years). Autoimmune disease (38%) was the most prevalent underlying disease followed by cancer (23%). Most patients were White males.

Previously, 40 days earlier, he had received the first injection of the vaccine, and 33 days earlier, the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. Laboratory tests showed nephrotic proteinuria (7.9 gr/day), microhematuria, serum creatinine 0.91 mg/dL. Kidney biopsy revealed ultrastructural evidence of severe endothelial cell injury suggestive of a starting phase of TMA. After high-dose steroid treatment administration, complete remission of proteinuria was achieved in a few weeks. The association of COVID-19 with renal TMA has been previously described only in patients with acute renal injury. Besides, the correlation with COVID-19 vaccine has not been reported so far. The close temporal proximity (7 days) between the two events opens the question whether the histological findings should be ascribed to COVID-19 itself or to vaccine injection.",Vaccine Publication

Vaccination of patients with rheumatic diseases is recommended, as they are considered at higher risk of severe COVID-19 than the general population. Patients with rheumatic disease have largely been excluded from vaccine phase 3 trials. This study explores the safety and reactogenicity of BNT162b2 among patients with rheumatic diseases. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), median age 58.8 years, 285 subjects in total, were vaccinated twice with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech). Questionnaires on reactogenicity matching the original phase 3 study were answered seven days after completed vaccination. The majority of SLE and RA patients experienced either local (78.0%) or systemic reactions (80.1%). Only 1.8% experienced a grade-4 reaction. Compared to the original study, we found more frequent fatigue [Odds ratio (OR) 2.2 (1.7-2.8)], headache [OR 1.7 (1.3-2.2)], muscle pain [OR 1.8 (1.4-2.3)], and joint pain [OR 2.3 (1.7-3.0)] in patients. In contrast, the use of antipyretics was less frequent [OR 0.5 (0.3-0.6)]. Patients with SLE and RA experience reactogenicity to the",Vaccine Publication

METHODS: RMD patients (n = 1,377) who received 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination between December 16, 2020 and April 15, 2021 completed questionnaires detailing local and systemic reactions experienced within 7 days of each vaccine dose (dose 1 and dose 2), and 1 month after dose 2, detailing any flares of RMD. Associations between demographic/clinical characteristics and flares requiring treatment were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among the patients, 11% reported flares requiring treatment; there were no reports of severe flares. Flares were associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.09, P = 0.02), flares in the 6 months preceding vaccination (IRR 2.36, P < 0.001), and the use of combination immunomodulatory therapy (IRR 1.95, P < 0.001). The most frequently reported local and systemic reactions included injection site pain (87% after dose 1, 86% after dose 2) and fatigue (60% after dose 1, 80% after dose 2). Reactogenicity increased after dose 2, particularly for systemic reactions. No allergic reactions or SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses were reported. CONCLUSION: Flares of underlying RMD following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were uncommon. There were no reports of severe flares. Local and systemic reactions typically did not interfere with daily activity. These early safety data can help address vaccine hesitancy in RMD patients.",Vaccine Publication

Of the total number of patients seen in the service, 100 received the vaccine's 1st dose, and 90 patients received the 2nd dose; 90% and 92.2% presented symptoms within 10 days after immunization (1st and 2nd doses, respectively), being pain at the inoculation site the most frequent (87%); most of the symptoms presented were of mild intensity. There were 27 episodes of post-immunization flare, 9% and 20% after the 1st and 2nd doses, respectively; the predominant type of flare was articular (85.1%), followed by dermal (18.5%). It was found that a history of renal involvement was associated with the risk of developing flare RR 0.38 (0.15-0.91) and the use of hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine prior to immunization 0.20 (0.06-0.63) and 7.96 (2.70-23.43) respectively.

All patients presented with thyrotoxicosis but with negative thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins for Graves disease and no autonomous nodules. Two patients underwent thyroid uptake scans that confirmed thyroiditis. One patient had significantly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and interleukin-6. All patients showed improvement in symptoms with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 1 patient eventually required steroids for symptom control. DISCUSSION: The mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 was associated with thyroiditis and led to thyrotoxicosis. Elevated proinflammatory markers and cytokines after vaccines may play a major role.

Infective processes, including that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are recognised as the major precipitant of adrenal crises. Adverse reactions to the ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine occur in a significant proportion of individuals, however, are mild-moderate in the majority of cases. DESIGN: Case series. PATIENTS & RESULTS: We describe five cases where more severe adverse reactions to the ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine led to actual or incipient adrenal crises requiring parenteral hydrocortisone within 24 h of receiving the first ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. CONCLUSION: In individuals with adrenal insufficiency, adverse reactions to the initial dose of the ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can precipitate adrenal crises. We recommend that patients with AI should immediately increase their maintenance glucocorticoid dosage 2-3 fold on experiencing any symptoms in the initial 24 h following vaccination.",Vaccine Publication

They developed fever, myalgia, joint pain, and swelling three to seven days after vaccination. The symptoms persisted for up to 47 days despite antipyretic treatment. Arthralgia occurred in multiple joints, including small and large joints.

The many reports of VITT have mostly been in the Caucasian population. Here, we present the first reported case in an Asian population. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old female had severe headache and severe thrombocytopenia 8 days after administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca. Although no thrombosis was demonstrated by imaging studies, she had very highly elevated d-dimer levels during hospitalization. Serology for antibodies against platelet factor 4 was positive on several days with very high optical density readings. We found that the antibody could induce spontaneous platelet aggregation without the presence of heparin. We decided to treat her with intravenous immunoglobulin, high-dose dexamethasone, and a prophylactic dose of apixaban. She improved rapidly and was discharged from the hospital 6 days after admission. Neither thrombocytopenia nor thrombosis was subsequently detected at the three-week follow-up.

Major complications of vaccines are thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in which pathogenetic mechanism is consistent with endotheliopathy characterized by ""attenuated"" sepsis-like syndrome, leading to the activation of inflammatory and microthrombotic pathway. In the COVID-19 pandemic, acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by microthrombosis has been the major clinical phenotype from the viral sepsis in association with endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD), sometimes presenting with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome. Often, venous thromboembolism has coexisted due to additional vascular injury. In contrast, clinical phenotypes of vaccine complication have included ""silent"" immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP-like syndrome), multiorgan inflammatory syndrome, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in particular. These findings are consistent with venous (v) EA-VMTD. In vEA-VMTD promoted by activated complement system following vaccination, ""consumptive"" thrombocytopenia develops as ITP-like syndrome due to activated unusually large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) path of hemostasis via microthrombogenesis. Thus, the pathologic phenotype of ITP-like syndrome is venous microthrombosis. Myocarditis/pericarditis and other rare cases of inflammatory organ syndrome are promoted by inflammatory cytokines released from activated inflammatory pathway, leading to various organ endotheliitis.",Vaccine Publication

However, no method for assessing the relationships between vaccines and the development of autoimmune diseases has been established. Aplastic anemia (AA) is an immune-mediated bone marrow failure syndrome. We report a case of severe AA that arose after the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine (the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine), which was treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this patient, antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected both before and after the HSCT. After the patient's hematopoietic stem cells were replaced through HSCT, his AA improved despite the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In this case, antibodies derived from the COVID-19 vaccine may not have been directly involved in the development of AA. This case suggests that the measurement of vaccine antibody titers before and after allogeneic HSCT may provide clues to the pathogenesis of vaccine-related autoimmune diseases. Although causality was not proven in this case, further evaluations are warranted to assess the associations between vaccines and AA.",Vaccine Publication

ITP is a known complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the first studies of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine, there were no reports of ITP and the incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was low overall. Here, we present a case of ITP as a complication of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. CASE REPORT Three days after receiving a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, a 39-year-old woman presented with a petechial rash on her trunk, legs, and arms, and fatigue and muscle aches. At the time of her hospital admission, her platelet count was 1000/µL. A peripheral smear showed profound thrombocytopenia. During the course of the patient's hospitalization, she was treated with 2 units of platelets, 2 infusions of i.v. immunoglobulin, and i.v. methylprednisolone. Her platelet count increased to 92 000/µL on the day of discharge and she was prescribed a tapered dose of oral prednisone. One day later, her rash had resolved and her platelet count was 243 000/µL. The patient recovered completely with no complications. CONCLUSIONS ITP should be considered a severe AE of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Knowing the early signs and symptoms of ITP will become increasingly important as more of the population receives this vaccine.

AHA can be idiopathic or occur in the context of malignancy, autoimmune disease, drugs, or pregnancy. Recently, cases of AHA following both COVID-19 infection and vaccination have been reported. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 95-year-old female who was immunised with the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, with doses given three weeks apart. Spontaneous bruising over her extremities appeared one week after the initial dose, with hospital admission occurring three weeks after the second. Examination revealed a large haematoma on the dorsum of the right hand with resultant bleeding and widespread ecchymoses. Investigations confirmed a diagnosis of AHA. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Initial management included high dose prednisolone, recombinant Factor VIII and tranexamic acid. There was no significant clinical improvement after three days, so intravenous rituximab 100 mg weekly for four weeks was commenced. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) normalised after two doses and Factor VIII level reached 0.68U/ml on day + 22. The patient was successfully discharged from hospital after 37 days. DISCUSSION: Four cases of AHA following administration of COVID mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) have been documented. AHA should be a differential in patients presenting with bleeding following COVID-19 vaccination, in the presence of a normal platelet count. Rapid recognition, prompt initiation of immunosuppressive treatment and rigorous supportive cares are required to minimise morbidity and mortality.",Vaccine Publication

The spectrum of clinical manifestations included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, arterial cerebral thromboembolism, and thrombotic microangiopathy. All patients had thrombocytopenia and markedly elevated D-dimer. Autoantibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) were detected in all patients, although they had never been exposed to heparin. Immunoglobulin from patient sera bound to healthy donor platelets in an AZD1222-dependent manner, suppressed by heparin. Aggregation of healthy donor platelets by patient sera was demonstrated in the presence of buffer or AZD1222 and was also suppressed by heparin.

We describe VITT syndrome characterized by severe thrombosis and thrombocytopenia found in our patient, with fatal outcome. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old man, after 13 days from the first administration of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca), presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomitus. Laboratory tests revealed a severe thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen serum levels and marked increase of D-dimer serum levels. The patient quickly developed a multiple organ failure, till death, three days after the hospital admission. RESULTS: At histology, in the lungs, interalveolar septa appeared thickened with microthrombi in the capillaries and veins. Interalveolar septa appeared thickened and showed vascular proliferation. Thrombi were detected in the capillaries of glomerular tufts. In the hearth, thrombi were observed in veins and capillaries. In the liver, voluminous fibrin thrombi were diffusely observed in the branches of the portal vein. Microthrombi were also found in the vasa vasorum of the wall of abdominal aorta. In the brain, microthrombi were observed in the capillaries of the choroid plexuses. Diffuse hemorrhagic necrosis was observed in the intestinal wall with marked congestion of the venous vessels. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient, the majority of data necessary for a VITT final diagnosis were present: thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in pulmonary, portal, hepatic, renal and mesenteric veins, associated with a marked increase of D-dimer serum levels. The finding of cerebral thrombosis in choroid plexuses, is a new finding in VITT. These features are suggestive for a very aggressive form of VITT.",Vaccine Publication

This is a life-threating condition that may be accompanied by bleeding due to thrombocytopenia with thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinus or splanchnic vein. Herein, we describe the first fatal case of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome in Korea, presenting with intracranial hemorrhage caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A 33-year-old Korean man received the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. He developed severe headache with vomiting 9 days after the vaccination. Twelve days after vaccination, he was admitted to the hospital with neurological symptoms and was diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, which was accompanied by intracranial hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia and D-dimer elevation were observed, and the result of the PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody test was reported to be strongly positive. Despite intensive treatment, including intravenous immunoglobulin injection and endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, the patient died 19 days after vaccination. Physicians need to be aware of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) in adenoviral vector-vaccinated patients. Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy might be a useful therapeutic option for the treatment of TTS with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.",Vaccine Publication

All cases had received ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine 1-2 weeks earlier and developed a characteristic syndrome thereafter. The rapid progressive clinical course and high fatality rate of CVT in combination with thrombocytopenia in such a cluster and in otherwise healthy adults is a recent phenomenon. Cerebral autopsy findings were those of venous hemorrhagic infarctions and thrombi in dural venous sinuses, including thrombus material apparently rich in thrombocytes, leukocytes and fibrin. Vessel walls were free of inflammation. Extra-cerebral manifestations included leech-like thrombi in large veins, fibrin clots in small venules and scattered hemorrhages on skin and membranes. CVT with thrombocytopenia after adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccination is a new clinical syndrome that needs to be recognized by clinicians, is challenging to treat and seems associated with a high mortality rate.",Vaccine Publication

CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 42-year-old woman presenting to the emergency department 53 days after AZD1222 vaccination with sudden onset sensory aphasia and an 18-day history of headache. Cranial computed tomography (CT) showed acute intracranial hemorrhage and CT venogram demonstrated thrombosis of the left vein of Labbé and transverse and sigmoid sinus. D-dimers were elevated and despite a normal platelet count, platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibody testing was positive, confirming the diagnosis of VITT. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and argatroban, and was discharged without any neurological deficit on day 12. CONCLUSION: Our report of VITT with symptom onset on day 35 and diagnosis of cerebral sinuous thrombosis on day 53 after AZD1222 vaccination significantly enhances the time window during which VITT may occur.",Vaccine Publication

In some cases, vaccine-related lymphadenopathy and FDG uptake on PET/CT can mimic cancer and lead to confounding imaging results. These cases where findings overlap with cancer pose a significant dilemma for diagnostic purposes, follow-up, and management leading to possible treatment delays, unnecessary repeat imaging and sampling, and patient anxiety. These cases can largely be avoided by optimal coordination between vaccination and planned imaging as well as preemptive selection of vaccine administration site. This coordination hinges on patient, oncologist, and radiologists' awareness of this issue and collaboration.

In general, unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy has a broad differential including malignancy, infection, autoimmune disorder, and iatrogenic etiologies. We present a case of a previously healthy 38-year-old woman who received her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior to presenting to the emergency department complaining of 2 weeks of abdominal pain and 20-pound unintentional weight loss. Unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, ipsilateral to the vaccination site, was found on a contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Subsequent diagnostic mammograms did not demonstrate evidence of malignancy; however, axillary ultrasound again revealed nonspecific lymphadenopathy. A short-term follow-up axillary ultrasound was recommended, rather than a lymph node biopsy, given the history of recent vaccination. At clinical follow-up, the patient's abdominal pain resolved and no further weight loss was noted.

Furthermore, 1.82 million booster doses have been administered in the US since 13th August, and similar booster programmes are currently planned or under consideration in the UK and the EU beginning in the autumn of 2021. Early reports showed an association between vaccine administration and the development of ipsilateral axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, which could interfere with the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of breast cancer patients. In this paper, we review the available evidence on vaccine-related lymphadenopathy, and we discuss the clinical implications of the same on breast cancer diagnosis and management. METHODS: A literature search was performed - PubMed, Ovid Medline, Scopus, CINHAL, Springer Nature, ScienceDirect, Academic Search Premier and the Directory of Open Access Journals were searched for articles reporting on regional palpable or image-detected lymphadenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination. Separately, we compiled a series of case studies from the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, United Kingdom and the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, United States of America, to illustrate the impact that regional lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination can have on the diagnosis and management of patients being seen in diagnostic and therapeutic breast clinics. RESULTS: From the literature search, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 2057 patients, 737 with lymphadenopathy). The incidence of lymphadenopathy ranged between 14.5% and 53% and persisted for >6 weeks in 29% of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study in a single tertiary care institution. We investigate the occurrence and pattern of HAL on FDG PET/CT scans from 650 consecutive cancer patients with recent BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Between December 20, 2020, and February 8, 2021, 650 patients (351 female patients [54%]; mean age, 68.9 years) had recent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and an FDG PET/CT scan. HALs were found in 57 (14.5%) of 394 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9%-18.7%) 12.3 ± 5.9 (1-22) days after dose 1 and in 111 (43.3%) of 256 patients (95% CI, 35.3%-52.2%; P < 0.0001) after 7.5 ± 5.4 (1-22) days after dose 2.

Fortunately, sufficient vaccines are now available. Local reactions with ipsilateral lymphadenopathy are among the most common side effects. We investigated the impact of lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination on the value of ultrasound in tumour patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with melanoma or Merkel cell carcinoma were included who underwent lymph node excision and received COVID-19 vaccination within 6 weeks before surgery. The consistency of the preoperative ultrasound findings with the histopathologic findings was investigated. RESULTS: Eight patients were included (two Merkel cell carcinoma and six melanoma patients) who underwent lymph node excision between 16th April 2021 and 19th May 2021 and had previously received COVID-19 vaccination. In three of the eight patients (one Merkel cell carcinoma and two melanoma patients), lymph node metastases were erroneously diagnosed preoperatively during tumour follow-up with physical examination, ultrasound, and or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). In these three patients, the suspected lymph node metastases were located in the left axilla after COVID-19 vaccination in the left upper arm, which resulted in selective lymph node removal in two patients and complete lymphadenectomy in one patient. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy is expected to be observed much more frequently in the near future because of increasing vaccination rates. This cause of lymphadenopathy, which may in ultrasound as well as in FDG PET/CT resemble lymph node metastases, must be considered, especially in oncologic patients undergoing tumour follow-up. In addition, COVID-19 vaccination should be given as far away as possible from an underlying primary on the contralateral side to avoid oncologic misdiagnosis followed by malpractice.",Vaccine Publication

We analyzed imaging and clinical features from early cases of axillary LAP in six COVID-19 vaccine recipients with a history of breast cancer. METHOD: Among the patients with a history of breast cancer and recent COVID-19 vaccine administration, six patients who showed isolated axillary LAP were gathered. Radiologic features were reviewed from breast ultrasound, chest computed tomography, and breast magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical and pathological information were obtained for analysis. RESULTS: The interval between ultrasound detection of LAP and last COVID-19 vaccine administration ranged from 14 to 28 days (mean 21.67 days). Round shape of the lymph node and irregular cortex were noted in 2 and 0 cases, respectively. Mean maximum cortical thickness, length to width ratio and interval aggravation in maximum cortical thickening were 4.2 mm, 1.34, and 2.81-fold with cut-off value of 3 mm, 1.5, 2.0-fold, respectively. CONCLUSION: We observed axillary LAP ipsilateral to a recent vaccine administration persisting longer than what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced.

Methods: We analyzed 1,018 PET/CT studies performed between January 1, 2021, and February 15, 2021. Information about the dates and sites of vaccination was collected. Visual and semiquantitative analysis of axillary-neck lymphadenopathy and arm uptake was correlated with immunization data. Results: Increased uptake in axillary lymphadenopathy was observed unilaterally in 66% of vaccinated patients, in 55% of patients vaccinated once, and in 69% of those vaccinated twice. The intensity of uptake decreased over time. Fifty-four of 274 patients (20%) had simultaneous increased activity in the posterior arm and ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (double sign [DS]).

This phenomenon may confound interpretation in patients with cancer undergoing FDG PET/CT. In this article, we present our institutional approach for management of COVID-19 vaccine-related lymphadenopathy on FDG PET/CT according to early experience. We suggest performing PET/CT at least 2 weeks after vaccination in patients with a cancer for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination but optimally 4-6 weeks after vaccination given increased immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines and potentially longer time for resolution than lymphadenopathy after other vaccines. PET/CT should not be delayed when clinically indicated to be performed sooner. Details regarding vaccination should be collected at the time of PET/CT to facilitate interpretation. Follow-up recommendations for postvaccination lymphadenopathy are provided, considering the lymph node's morphology and likely clinical relevance. Consideration should be given to administering the vaccine in the arm contralateral to a unilateral cancer to avoid confounding FDG uptake on the side of cancer. Our preliminary experience and suggested institutional approach should guide radiologists in management of patients with cancer undergoing PET/CT after COVID-19 vaccination.",Vaccine Publication

PR is a self-limiting exanthematous disease and herpes zoster is a treatable condition; therefore, their occurrence does not require discontinuation of the vaccination schedule. PR-LE is a hypersensitivity reaction and is, therefore, less predictable in its course. In the case of a booster dose, the clinical manifestation may not recur, may be different from PR-LE, or may present with systemic symptoms; however, in the case of PR-LE, the possibility of mild and predominantly cutaneous adverse events should not discourage all eligible candidates from receiving and completing the COVID-19 vaccination program, as such adverse reactions represent a small risk considering the possible severe and fatal outcome of COVID-19. We emphasize the relevance of looking for any viral reactivation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have skin eruptions. The search for viral reactivations could be useful not only for distinguishing between PR and PR-LE but also because viral reactivations may contribute to a patient's systemic inflammation and influence the course of the disease.",Vaccine Publication

(4) Conclusions: The clinico-pathological spectrum of cutaneous side effects with COVID-19 vaccines is wide; however, the benefits outweigh the risks by far. More dermatopathological studies on cutaneous ADR not limited to COVID-19 vaccines are desirable to enable a better understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.",Vaccine Publication

Vaccines are a very useful new tool against COVID-19 that stimulate the immune system after recognition of viruses or their parts. Complications post vaccination could happen and they depend on the types, vaccine mechanism of action as well as some other patients' factors. CASE REPORT: We are reporting a 39 years old lady who is known as allergic to a strawberry and kiwi, otherwise medically free. She presented to the outpatient unit with a ten-days history of palms of the hands and soles of the feet itchiness that is associated with occasional redness after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination. There were no skin rashes or pruritis at any other sites. The patient was treated conservatively by antihistamine and the symptoms gradually resolved within five days.

Among the adverse events, we focused particularly on skin rashes. In this short report, we describe the case of a patient vaccinated with Comirnaty, who developed a purpuric rash resistant to oral steroid therapy after 2 weeks. To date, this is one of the very few cases in which skin biopsy was performed to better characterize the histopathological picture of this rash.

Recently, delayed skin reactions have been reported in 1% individuals following mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The exact pathophysiology and the risk factors still remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 6821 employees and patients were vaccinated at our institutions between February and June 2021. Every patient received two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in our hospitals, and reported back in case of any side effects which were collected in our hospital managed database. RESULTS: Eleven of 6821 vaccinated patients (0.16%) developed delayed skin reactions after either the first or second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Eight of 11 patients (73%) developed a rash after the first dose, while in 3/11 (27%), the rash occurred after the second dose. More females (9/11) were affected. Four of 11 patients required antihistamines, with two needing additional topical steroids. All the cutaneous manifestations resolved within 14 days. None of the skin reactions after the first dose of the vaccine prevented the administration of the second dose. There were no long-term cutaneous sequelae in any of the affected individuals.

OBJECTIVE: To describe and classify cutaneous reactions after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS: A nationwide Spanish cross-sectional study was conducted. We included patients with cutaneous reactions within 21 days of any dose of the approved vaccines at the time of the study. After a face-to-face visit with a dermatologist, information on cutaneous reactions was collected via an online professional survey and clinical photographs were sent by email. Investigators searched for consensus on clinical patterns and classification. RESULTS: From 16 February to 15 May 2021, we collected 405 reactions after vaccination with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech; 40·2%), mRNA-1273 (Moderna; 36·3%) and AZD1222 (AstraZeneca; 23·5%) vaccines. Mean patient age was 50·7 years and 80·2% were female. Cutaneous reactions were classified as injection site ('COVID arm', 32·1%), urticaria (14·6%), morbilliform (8·9%), papulovesicular (6·4%), pityriasis rosea-like (4·9%) and purpuric (4%) reactions. Varicella zoster and herpes simplex virus reactivations accounted for 13·8% of reactions. The COVID arm was almost exclusive to women (95·4%). The most reported reactions in each vaccine group were COVID arm (mRNA-1273, Moderna, 61·9%), varicella zoster virus reactivation (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech, 17·2%) and urticaria (AZD1222, AstraZeneca, 21·1%). Most reactions to the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine were described in women (90·5%). Eighty reactions (21%) were classified as severe/very severe and 81% required treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous reactions after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are heterogeneous. Most are mild-to-moderate and self-limiting, although severe/very severe reactions are reported. Knowledge of these reactions during mass vaccination may help healthcare professionals and reassure patients.",Vaccine Publication

The objective of this review was to summarize the existing data concerning the cutaneous adverse reactions following SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and group them according to common morphological and pathogenetic patterns. We reviewed the English language literature up to 15 August 2021, using predefined keywords to identify the relevant studies evaluating cutaneous adverse reactions associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We search for recurrent morphological patterns sharing clinical signs and symptoms and physio-pathological mechanisms. Timing to onset following the first or booster dose of the vaccine, predisposing conditions, therapeutic management, and outcome were also collected. Among the dermatological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, we distinguished: (1) new onset reactions and (2) flares of preexisting dermatoses. The most common were injection site reactions, affecting 30-70% and generally mild or moderate. Small case series or single case reports included filler reactions, exanthemas, vascular lesions, urticaria, eczematous dermatitis, autoimmune bullous reactions, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. In addition, the exacerbation of chronic immuno-mediated dermatoses (mainly psoriasis and atopic dermatitis) and reactivations of herpes infection were reported. The cutaneous reactions were generally mild, self-limiting, and resembled common cutaneous drug eruptions and/or COVID-19 skin manifestations.",Vaccine Publication

METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective case series, biopsy specimens of potential cutaneous adverse reactions from the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine were identified and reviewed. Clinical information was obtained through the requisition form, referring clinician, or medical chart review. RESULTS: Twelve cases were included. Histopathological features from two injection-site reactions showed a mixed-cell infiltrate with eosinophils and a spongiotic dermatitis with eosinophils. Three biopsy specimens came from generalized eruptions that showed interface changes consistent with an exanthematous drug reaction. Three biopsy specimens revealed a predominantly spongiotic pattern, consistent with eczematous dermatitis. Small-vessel vascular injury was seen in two specimens, which were diagnosed as urticarial vasculitis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis, respectively. There were two cases of new-onset bullous pemphigoid supported by histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence studies. Eosinophils were seen in 10 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatopathologists should be aware of potential cutaneous adverse reactions to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Histopathological patterns include mixed-cell infiltrates, epidermal spongiosis, and interface changes. Eosinophils are a common finding but are not always present. Direct immunofluorescence studies may be helpful for immune-mediated cutaneous presentations such as vasculitis or bullous pemphigoid.",Vaccine Publication

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the morphology and timing of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: A provider-facing registry-based study collected cases of cutaneous manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: From December 2020 to February 2021, we recorded 414 cutaneous reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna (83%) and Pfizer (17%). Delayed large local reactions were most common, followed by local injection site reactions, urticarial eruptions, and morbilliform eruptions. Forty-three percent of patients with first-dose reactions experienced second-dose recurrence. Additional less common reactions included pernio/chilblains, cosmetic filler reactions, zoster, herpes simplex flares, and pityriasis rosea-like reactions. LIMITATIONS: Registry analysis does not measure incidence. Morphologic misclassification is possible. CONCLUSIONS: We report a spectrum of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We observed some dermatologic reactions to Moderna and Pfizer vaccines that mimicked SARS-CoV-2 infection itself, such as pernio/chilblains. Most patients with first-dose reactions did not have a second-dose reaction and serious adverse events did not develop in any of the patients in the registry after the first or second dose.

While reactions of eyelids and conjunctiva are commonly reported, the most frequently implicated serious adverse events are optic neuritis and various patterns of intraocular inflammation. Live attenuated vaccines have the potential to cause ocular infection from vaccine-strain organisms, particularly in those immunosuppressed. While postmarketing registries for suspect vaccination adverse events, such as VAERS, are unable to determine causal associations, they are a mainstay in signaling suspected trends that require investigation. The majority of probable and possible serious ocular adverse effects are distinctly uncommon.",Vaccine Publication

METHODS: Multinational case series of patients diagnosed with an ocular inflammatory event within 14 days following COVID-19 vaccination collected from 40 centres over a 3 month period in 2021. RESULTS: Seventy patients presented with ocular inflammatory events within 14 days following COVID-19 vaccination. The mean age was 51 years (range, 19-84 years). The most common events were anterior uveitis (n = 41, 58.6%), followed by posterior uveitis (n = 9, 12.9%) and scleritis (n = 7, 10.0%). The mean time to event was 5 days and 6 days (range, 1-14 days) after the first and second dose of vaccine, respectively. Among all patients, 36 (54.1%) had a previous history of ocular inflammatory event. Most patients (n = 48, 68.6%) were managed with topical corticosteroids. Final vision was not affected in 65 (92.9%), whereas 2 (2.9%) and 3 (4.3%) had reduction in visual acuity reduced by ≤3 lines and > 3 lines, respectively. Reported complications included nummular corneal lesions (n = 1, 1.4%), cystoid macular oedema (n = 2, 2.9%) and macular scarring (n = 2, 2.9%). CONCLUSION: Ocular inflammatory events may occur after COVID-19 vaccination. The findings are based on a temporal association that does not prove causality. Even in the possibility of a causal association, most of the events were mild and had a good visual outcome.",Vaccine Publication

METHODS: Case Report. RESULTS: A 51-year-old man with a history of keratoconus and penetrating keratoplasty underwent repeat penetrating keratoplasty for graft failure. The patient had an uncomplicated intraoperative and postoperative course with improved vision and a healthy graft. The patient received the SARS-CoV-2 Moderna vaccine on postoperative week 3, and within 3 days, the patient began developing eye pain, photophobia, and blurred vision. The patient was found to have graft rejection with corneal edema and endothelial keratic precipitates. The rejection did not improve despite a trial of increased topical steroids and ultimately evolved into graft failure. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this case of full-thickness graft rejection after the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination is the first to be reported worldwide. The temporal relationship between vaccination and subsequent rejection is highly suggestive of causation due to the short interval (3 days) between vaccination and rejection and the lack of other inciting factors in an otherwise healthy graft.

METHODS: Four patients with prior keratoplasty developed presumed immunologic rejection after the mRNA-1273 vaccination for coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Case 1 had received Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty 6 months ago and presented with endothelial graft rejection 3 weeks after the first vaccine dose. Case 2 had undergone penetrating keratoplasty 3 years previously and presented with acute endothelial rejection 9 days after the second vaccine dose. Case 3 had prior Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and began experiencing symptoms of endothelial graft rejection 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Case 4 presented with endothelial rejection of the penetrating keratoplasty graft 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose. RESULTS: Frequent topical corticosteroids alone were initiated in all 4 cases. In case 1, the endothelial rejection line appeared fainter with improvement in visual acuity and corneal edema 5 weeks after diagnosis. Case 2 experienced complete resolution of corneal stromal edema and rejection line 6 weeks after diagnosis. Cases 3 and 4 have both experienced initial improvement with steroid treatment as well. CONCLUSIONS: These cases suggest acute corneal endothelial rejection may occur soon after either dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Prompt initiation of aggressive topical steroid therapy may result in complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms.

METHODS: Retrospective observational case report. RESULTS: A 71-year-old gentleman presented to us with complaints of reduced vision associated with redness and pain in his right eye for 1 week. On examination he revealed a right eye pan uveitis picture with circumcorneal congestion, multiple fine keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells and flare, vitritis and widespread areas of acute retinal necrosis. His left eye was within normal limits. Ten days prior to the presentation he had received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine following which he had developed fever for 2 days that preceded the red eye. The patient's aqueous sample tested positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV) by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from the aqueous and also from the nasopharyngeal swab was negative.

It generally arises as a result of autoimmune conditions, infections, or ocular trauma, but it may also occur as an isolated disorder. Over the past decades, several cases of vaccine-associated uveitis have been described, with the hepatitis B virus vaccine being the leading cause. CLINICAL CASE: A case of anterior uveitis in a 23-year-old male, with onset 14 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine, is reported here. Initial symptoms were pain, photophobia, and red eye. Ocular examination showed pericheratic and conjunctival hyperaemia, posterior synechiae, and anterior chamber cells ± keratic precipitates in the lower quadrants. The posterior segment did not show any alteration, and optical coherence tomography ruled out the presence of cystoid macular oedema. After a 10-day treatment course of topical steroids and cycloplegic eye drops, the ocular inflammatory signs disappeared and visual acuity was completely restored.

A 39-year-old patient with no medical history presented with a vesicular rash, headache, nausea and fever, days after receiving BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. CSF analysis revealed a pleocytosis, and VZV DNA was confirmed by PCR testing. The patient received intravenous aciclovir with resolution of symptoms within 48 h. He was discharged after 14 days of treatment. Case reports of herpes zoster reactivation post vaccination and details of subsequent successful vaccination course completion have allowed us to recommend the patient receive his second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. At the time of writing, however, the patient has declined to receive further vaccination due to fears of an adverse event. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in a young patient of herpes zoster meningitis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.

The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness of reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD. METHODS: The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n = 491) and controls (n = 99), conducted in two rheumatology departments in Israel. RESULTS: The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n = 6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49 ± 11 years with stable AIIRD: RA (n = 4), Sjogren's syndrome (n = 1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n = 1), developed the first in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the first vaccine dose in five cases and after the second vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in an RA patient treated with tofacitinib.

Vaccination programmes are being rolled out globally, but most of these vaccines have been approved without extensive studies on their side-effects and efficacy. Recently, new-onset autoimmune phenomena after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported increasingly (e.g. immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, autoimmune liver diseases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, IgA nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus).

CASE SUMMARY: A 20-year-old male college student in good health developed tinnitus and hematuria shortly after vaccination and progressed swiftly to a syndrome of: systemic inflammation; acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis; acute, bilateral, complete sensorineural hearing loss; radiographic evidence of acute multifocal ischemic strokes; pericardial effusion complicated by tamponade physiology requiring pericardial evacuation; pleural effusions requiring evacuation; and systemic capillary leak. An extensive clinical and research investigation, including cytokine analysis, whole blood cytometry by time of flight, and whole exome sequencing, did not reveal a definitive explanatory mechanism. CONCLUSION: While the overall safety profile of the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine remains excellent for the general population, rare serious events have been reported. In this report, we describe a case of multisystem inflammation and organ dysfunction of unknown mechanism beginning shortly after administration of the first dose of BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in a previously healthy recipient.",Vaccine Publication

From 11.03.2021 to 09.06.2021, postmortem investigations of 18 deceased persons who recently received a vaccination against COVID-19 were performed. Vaxzevria was vaccinated in nine, Comirnaty in five, Spikevax in three, and Janssen in one person. In all cases, full autopsies, histopathological examinations, and virological analyses for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were carried out. Depending on the case, additional laboratory tests (anaphylaxis diagnostics, VITT [vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia] diagnostics, glucose metabolism diagnostics) and neuropathological examinations were conducted. In 13 deceased, the cause of death was attributed to preexisting diseases while postmortem investigations did not indicate a causal relationship to the vaccination. In one case after vaccination with Comirnaty, myocarditis was found to be the cause of death. A causal relationship to vaccination was considered possible, but could not be proven beyond doubt. VITT was found in three deceased persons following vaccination with Vaxzevria and one deceased following vaccination with Janssen. Of those four cases with VITT, only one was diagnosed before death. The synopsis of the anamnestic data, the autopsy results, laboratory diagnostic examinations, and histopathological and neuropathological examinations revealed that VITT was the very likely cause of death in only two of the four cases. In the other two cases, no neuropathological correlate of VITT explaining death was found, while possible causes of death emerged that were not necessarily attributable to VITT. The results of our study demonstrate the necessity of postmortem investigations on all fatalities following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines. In order to identify a possible causal relationship between vaccination and death, in most cases an autopsy and histopathological examinations have to be combined with additional investigations, such as laboratory tests and neuropathological examinations.",Vaccine Publication

Similar changes had also been reported in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that vaccination mimicked an infection. Single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and 28 days after the first inoculation also revealed consistent alterations in gene expression of many different immune cell types. Reduction of CD8(+) T cells and increase in classic monocyte contents were exemplary. Moreover, scRNA-seq revealed increased NF-κB signaling and reduced type I interferon responses, which were confirmed by biological assays and also had been reported to occur after SARS-CoV-2 infection with aggravating symptoms.

In this report, we aimed to describe fatal and non-fatal possible AEs after COVID-19 vaccine administration. METHODS: An observational multicenter study investigating the causes of emergency department visits and hospital admissions within 10 days of COVID-19 vaccination. Patients who received first or second doses of COVID-19 vaccines and presented to the emergency department (ED), as well as those admitted to the hospitals or intensive care units (ICUs) were included. Causes of ED, hospital, and ICU admissions and discharges were collected based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding system. RESULTS: Between December 2020 and March 2021, 1842 patients visited the ED within 10 days of COVID-19 vaccine administration. The mean age was 70.3 years. Overall, 1221 patients presented after the first dose of the vaccine and 653 after the second dose. Trauma (14.9%), hypertensive emergency/urgency (7.8%), generalized pain and arthralgia (5.7%), and chest pain (4.4%) were the most common causes of presentation to the ED. Of all ED presentations, mortality rate was at 2.2% (41 patients) with a median follow-up time of 68.0 days, versus 2.6% in unvaccinated ED patients. Postvaccination acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (46.3%), septic shock (24.4%), and cardiogenic shock (12.2%) were the most common causes of death. CONCLUSION: Although reported AEs are not necessarily caused by the vaccination, this study provides further information about possible AEs after COVID-19 immunization, especially those requiring hospital admission. This study also supports prior data that serious AEs post vaccination are much lower than primary",Vaccine Publication

Many reports indicate that a considerable number of patients who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. However, increasing evidence suggests that many such patients who either recovered from or had mild symptoms after COVID-19 exhibit diffuse, multiorgan, symptoms months after the infection. These symptoms include malaise, myalgias, chest tightness, brain fog and other neuropsychiatric symptoms that were originally reported in children and named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). Now the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) announced the recognition of a similar condition in adults, named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-A). The symptoms characterizing these conditions are very similar to those associated with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS, US ICD-110 code D89.42-idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome). Hence, the possibility of MCAS should be evaluated in any patient with MIS and/or multisystem inflammatory symptoms. In either case, these syndromes should be addressed with liposomal formulation (in olive pomace oil) of the flavone luteolin (e.g. PureLut® or FibroProtek®) together with the antihistamine rupatadine, which also has anti-platelet activating factor (PAF) activity and inhibits mast cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cytokine storms in COVID-19.",COVID‐19 Publication
